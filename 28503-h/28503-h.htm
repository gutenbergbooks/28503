<div class="blockquot2"><p>"The Wit of Women," by Miss Kate Sanborn, [Funk
&amp; Wagnalls,] proves that the authoress is one of those
rare women who are gifted with a sense of humor. Fortunately
for her, the female sense of humor, when it does
exist, is not affected by such trifles as "chestnuts." Therefore,
women will read with pleasure Miss Sanborn's
choice collection of these dainties. There are, however,
many new anecdotes in Miss Sanborn's collection, and,
taken as a whole, it may fairly be said to establish the
fact that there have been feminine wits not inferior to the
best of the opposite sex.<br />

<p>It is refreshing to find an unworked field all ready for
harvesting.</p>

<p>While the wit of men, as a subject for admiration and
discussion, is now threadbare, the wit of women has been
almost utterly ignored and unrecognized.</p>

<p>With the joy and honest pride of a discoverer, I present
the results of a summer's gleaning.</p>

<p>And I feel a cheerful and Colonel Sellers-y confidence in
the success of the book, for every woman will want to own
it, as a matter of pride and interest, and many men will
buy it just to see what women think they can do in this
line. In fact, I expect a call for a second volume!</p>

<div class="blockquot2"><p><i>"There was in her soul a sense of delicacy mingled with that rarest of
qualities in woman&mdash;a sense of humor," writes Richard Grant White in
"The Fate of Mansfield Humphreys." I have noticed that when a
novelist sets out to portray an uncommonly fine type of heroine, he invariably
adds to her other intellectual and moral graces the above-mentioned
"rarest of qualities." I may be over-sanguine, but I anticipate that
some sagacious genius will discover that woman as well as man has been
endowed with this excellent gift from the gods, and that the gift pertains
to the large, generous, sympathetic nature, quite irrespective of the individual's
sex. In any case, having heard so repeatedly that woman has no
sense of humor, it would be refreshing to have a contrariety of opinion on
that subject.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Critic.</span></p></div>

<p class="blockintro">THE MELANCHOLY TONE OF WOMEN'S POETRY&mdash;PUNS, GOOD
AND BAD&mdash;EPIGRAMS AND LACONICS&mdash;CYNICISM OF FRENCH
WOMEN&mdash;SENTENCES CRISP AND SPARKLING.</p>

<p>To begin a deliberate search for wit seems almost like
trying to be witty: a task quite certain to brush the bloom
from even the most fruitful results. But the statement of
Richard Grant White, that humor is the "rarest of qualities
in woman," roused such a host of brilliant recollections that
it was a temptation to try to materialize the ghosts that
were haunting me; to lay forever the suspicion that they did
not exist. Two articles by Alice Wellington Rollins in the
<i>Critic</i>, on "Woman's Sense of Humor" and "The Humor
of Women," convinced me that the deliberate task might
not be impossible to carry out, although I felt, as she did,
that the humor and wit of women are difficult to analyze,
and select examples, precisely because they possess in the
highest degree that almost essential quality of wit, the unpremeditated
glow which exists only with the occasion that
calls it forth. Even from the humor of women found in
books it is hard to quote&mdash;not because there is so little, but
because there is so much.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span></p>

<p>The encouragement to attempt this novel enterprise of
proving ("by their fruits ye shall know them") that women
are not deficient in either wit or humor has not been great.
Wise librarians have, with a smile, regretted the paucity of
proper material; literary men have predicted rather a thin
volume; in short, the general opinion of men is condensed
in the sly question of a peddler who comes to our door,
summer and winter, his stock varying with the season:
sage-cheese and home-made socks, suspenders and cheap
note-paper, early-rose potatoes and the solid pearmain.
This shrewd old fellow remarked roguishly "You're
gittin' up a book, I see, 'baout women's wit. 'Twon't be
no great of an undertakin', will it?" The outlook at first
was certainly discouraging. In Parton's "Collection of
Humorous Poetry" there was not one woman's name, nor
in Dodd's large volume of epigrams of all ages, nor in
any of the humorous departments of volumes of selected
poetry.</p>

<p>Griswold's "Female Poets of America" was next examined.
The general air of gloom&mdash;hopeless gloom&mdash;was depressing.
Such mawkish sentimentality and despair; such
inane and mortifying confessions; such longings for a lover
to come; such sighings over a lover departed; such cravings
for "only"&mdash;"only" a <i>grave</i> in some dark, dank solitude.
As Mrs. Dodge puts it, "Pegasus generally feels
inclined to pace toward a graveyard the moment he feels a
side-saddle on his back."</p>

<p>The subjects of their lucubrations suggest Lady Montagu's
famous speech: "There was only one reason she
was glad she was a woman: she should never have to <i>marry</i>
one."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span></p>

<p>From the "Female Poets" I copy this "Song," representing
the average woman's versifying as regards buoyancy
and an optimistic view of this "Wale of Tears":</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ask not from me the sportive jest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The mirthful jibe, the gay reflection;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">These social baubles fly the breast<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That owns the sway of pale Dejection.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ask not from me the changing smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hope's sunny glow, Joy's glittering token;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It cannot now my griefs beguile&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My soul is dark, my heart is broken!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wit cannot cheat my heart of woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Flattery wakes no exultation;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And Fancy's flash but serves to show<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The darkness of my desolation!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"By me no more in masking guise<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shall thoughtless repartee be spoken;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My mind a hopeless ruin lies&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My soul is dark, my heart is broken!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In recalling the witty women of the world, I must surely
go back, familiar as is the story, to the Grecian dame who,
when given some choice old wine in a tiny glass by her
miserly host, who boasted of the years since it had been
bottled, inquired, "Isn't it very small of its age?"</p>

<p>This ancient story is too much in the style of the male
story-monger&mdash;you all know him&mdash;who repeats with undiminished
gusto for the forty-ninth time a story that was
tottering in senile imbecility when Methuselah was teething,
and is now in a sad condition of anec<i>dotage</i>.</p>

<p>It is affirmed that "women seldom repeat an anecdote."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>That is well, and no proof of their lack of wit. The discipline
of life would be largely increased if they did insist on
being "reminded" constantly of anecdotes as familiar as
the hand-organ repertoire of "Captain Jinks" and "Beautiful
Spring." Their sense of humor is too keen to allow
them to aid these aged wanderers in their endless migrations.
It is sufficiently trying to their sense of the ludicrous
to be obliged to listen with an admiring, rapt expression
to some anecdote heard in childhood, and restrain the
laugh until the oft-repeated crisis has been duly reached.
Still, I know several women who, as brilliant <i>raconteurs</i>,
have fully equalled the efforts of celebrated after-dinner
wits.</p>

<p>It is also affirmed that "women cannot make a pun,"
which, if true, would be greatly to their honor. But, alas!
their puns are almost as frequent and quite as execrable as
are ever perpetrated. It was Queen Elizabeth who said:
"Though ye be burly, my Lord Burleigh, ye make less stir
than my Lord Leicester."</p>

<p>Lady Morgan, the Irish novelist, witty and captivating,
who wrote "Kate Kearney" and the "Wild Irish Girl,"
made several good puns. Some one, speaking of the laxity
of a certain bishop in regard to Lenten fasting, said: "I
believe he would eat a horse on Ash Wednesday." "And
very proper diet," said her ladyship, "if it were a <i>fast</i>
horse."</p>

<p>Her special enemy, Croker, had declared that Wellington's
success at Waterloo was only a fortunate accident, and
intimated that he could have done better himself, under
similar circumstances. "Oh, yes," exclaimed her ladyship,
"he had his secret for winning the battle. He had
only to put his notes on Boswell's Johnson in front of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
British lines, and all the Bonapartes that ever existed could
never <i>get through</i> them!"</p>

<p>"Grace Greenwood" has probably made more puns in
print than any other woman, and her conversation is full of
them. It was Grace Greenwood who, at a tea-drinking at
the Woman's Club in Boston, was begged to tell one more
story, but excused herself in this way: "No, I cannot get
more than one story high on a cup of tea!"</p>

<p>You see puns are allowed at that rarely intellectual assemblage&mdash;indeed,
they are sometimes <i>very</i> bad; as when the
question was brought up whether better speeches could be
made after simple tea and toast, or under the influence of
champagne and oysters. Miss Mary Wadsworth replied
that it would depend entirely upon whether the oysters
were cooked or raw; and seeing all look blank, she explained:
"Because, if raw, we should be sure to have a
raw-oyster-ing time."</p>

<p>Louisa Alcott's puns deserve "honorable mention." I
will quote one. "Query&mdash;If steamers are named the Asia,
the Russia, and the Scotia, why not call one the <i>Nausea</i>?"</p>

<p>At a Chicago dinner-party a physician received a menu
card with the device of a mushroom, and showing it to the
lady next him, said: "I hope nothing invidious is intended."
"Oh, no," was the answer, "it only alludes to
the fact that you spring up in the night."</p>

<p>A gentleman, noticeable on the porch of the sanctuary as
the pretty girls came in on Sabbath mornings, but <i>not</i>
regarded as a devout attendant on the services within,
declared that he was one of the "pillars of the church!"
"Pillar-sham, I am inclined to think," was the retort of a
lady friend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span></p>

<p>To a lady who, in reply to a gentleman's assertion that
women sometimes made a good pun, but required time to
think about it, had said that <i>she</i> could make a pun as
quickly as any man, the gentleman threw down this challenge:
"Make a pun, then, on horse-shoe." "If you talk
until you're horse-shoe can't convince me," was the instant
answer.</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>The best punning poem from a woman's pen was written
by Miss Caroline B. Le Row, of Brooklyn, N.Y., a teacher
of elocution, and the writer of many charming stories and
verses. It was suggested by a study in butter of "The
Dreaming Iolanthe," moulded by Caroline S. Brooks on a
kitchen-table, and exhibited at the Centennial in Philadelphia.
I do not remember any other poem in the language
that rings so many changes on a single word. It was published
first in <i>Baldwin's Monthly</i>, but ran the rounds of
the papers all over the country.</p>

<p>The second and last example is much more common in its
form, but is just as good as most of the verses of this style
in Parton's "Humorous Poetry." I don't pretend that it is
remarkable, but it is equally worthy of presentation with
many efforts of this sort from men with a reputation for
wit.</p>

<p>As to puns in conversation, my only fear is that they are
too generally indulged in. Only one of this sort can be
allowed, and that from the highest lady in the land, who is
distinguished for culture and good sense, as well as wit. A
friend said to her as she was leaving Buffalo for Washington:
"I hope you will hail from Buffalo."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see you expect me to hail from Buffalo and reign
in Washington," said the quick-witted sister of our President.</p>

<p>In epigrams there is little to offer. But as it is stated
that "women cannot achieve a well-rounded epigram," a
few specimens must be produced.</p>

<p>Jane Austen has left two on record. The first was suggested
by reading in a newspaper the marriage of a Mr.
Gell to Miss Gill, of Eastborne.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"At Eastborne, Mr. Gell, from being perfectly well,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Became dreadfully ill for love of Miss Gill;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So he said, with some sighs, 'I'm the slave of your iis;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Oh, restore, if you please, by accepting my ees.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The second is on the marriage of a middle-aged flirt with
a Mr. Wake, whom gossips averred she would have scorned
in her prime.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Maria, good-humored and handsome and tall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For a husband was at her last stake;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And having in vain danced at many a ball,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is now happy to jump at a Wake."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span></p><p>It was Lady Townsend who said that the human race was
divided into men, women, and <i>Herveys</i>. This epigram has
been borrowed in our day, substituting for Herveys the
<i>Beecher</i> family.</p>

<p>When some one said of a lady she must be in spirits, for
she lives with Mr. Walpole, "Yes," replied Lady Townsend,
"spirits of hartshorn."</p>

<p>Walpole, caustic and critical, regarded this lady as undeniably
witty.</p>

<p>It was Hannah More who said: "There are but two bad
things in this world&mdash;sin and bile."</p>

<p>Miss Thackeray quotes several epigrammatic definitions
from her friend Miss Evans, as:</p>

<p>"A privileged person: one who is so much a savage
when thwarted that civilized persons avoid thwarting him."</p>

<p>"A musical woman: one who has strength enough to
make much noise and obtuseness enough not to mind it."</p>

<p>"Ouida" has given us some excellent examples of epigram,
as:</p>

<p>"A pipe is a pocket philosopher, a truer one than Socrates,
for it never asks questions. Socrates must have been very
tiresome, when one thinks of it."</p>

<p>"Dinna ye meddle, Tam; it's niver no good a threshin'
other folks' corn; ye allays gits the flail agin' i' yer own
eye somehow."</p>

<p>"Epigrams are the salts of life; but they wither up the
grasses of foolishness, and naturally the grasses hate to be
sprinkled therewith."</p>

<p>"A man never is so honest as when he speaks well of himself.
Men are always optimists when they look inward,
and pessimists when they look round them."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span></p>
<p>"Nothing is so pleasant as to display your worldly wisdom
in epigram and dissertation, but it is a trifle tedious to hear
another person display theirs."</p>

<p>"When you talk yourself you think how witty, how original,
how acute you are; but when another does so, you are
very apt to think only, 'What a crib from Rochefoucauld!'"</p>

<p>"Boredom is the ill-natured pebble that always <i>will</i> get in
the golden slipper of the pilgrim of pleasure."</p>

<p>"It makes all the difference in life whether hope is left
or&mdash;left out!"</p>

<p>"A frog that dwelt in a ditch spat at a worm that bore a
lamp.</p>

<p>"'Why do you do that?' said the glow-worm.</p>

<p>"'Why do you shine?' said the frog."</p>

<p>"Calumny is the homage of our contemporaries, as some
South Sea Islanders spit on those they honor."</p>

<p>"Hived bees get sugar because they will give back honey.
All existence is a series of equivalents."</p>

<p>"'Men are always like Horace,' said the Princess.
'They admire rural life, but they remain, for all that, with
Augustus.'"</p>

<p>"If the Venus de Medici could be animated into life,
women would only remark that her waist was large."</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>The brilliant Frenchwomen whose very names seem
to sparkle as we write them, yet of whose wit so little
has been preserved, had an especial facility for condensed
cynicism.</p>

<p>Think of Madame du Deffand, sceptical, sarcastic; feared
and hated even in her blind old age for her scathing criticisms.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>When the celebrated work of Helvetius appeared
he was blamed in her presence for having made selfishness
the great motive of human action.</p>

<p>"Bah!" said she, "he has only revealed every one's
secret."</p>

<p>And listen to this trio of laconics, with their saddening
knowledge of human frailty and their bitter Voltaireish
flavor:</p>

<p>We shall all be perfectly virtuous when there is no longer
any flesh on our bones.&mdash;<i>Marguerite de Valois.</i></p>

<p>We like to know the weakness of eminent persons; it
consoles us for our inferiority.&mdash;<i>Mme. de Lambert.</i></p>

<p>Women give themselves to God when the devil wants
nothing more to do with them.&mdash;<i>Sophie Arnould.</i></p>

<p>Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;'s letters present detached thoughts
worthy of Rochefoucauld without his cynicism. She writes:
"One loves so much to talk of one's self that one never tires
of a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with a lover for years. That is the reason
that a devotee likes to be with her confessor. It is for the
pleasure of talking of one's self&mdash;even though speaking evil."
And she remarks to a lady who amused her friends by always
going into mourning for some prince, or duke, or member of
some royal family, and who at last appeared in bright colors,
"Madame, I congratulate myself on the health of Europe."</p>

<p>I find, too, many fine aphorisms from "Carmen Sylva"
(Queen of Roumania):</p>

<p>"Il vaut mieux avoir pour confesseur un m&eacute;decin qu'un
pr&ecirc;tre. Vous dites au pr&ecirc;tre que vous d&eacute;testez les hommes,
il vous r&eacute;ponds que vous n'&ecirc;tes pas chr&eacute;tien. Le m&eacute;decin
vous donne de la rhubarbe, et voil&agrave; que vous aimez votre
semblable."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span></p>
<p>"Vous dites au pr&ecirc;tre que vous &ecirc;tes fatigu&eacute; de vivre; il vous r&eacute;ponds
que le suicide est un crime. Le m&eacute;decin vous
donne un stimulant, et voil&agrave; que vous trouvez la vie supportable."</p>

<p>"La contradiction anime la conversation; voil&agrave; pourquoi
les cours sont si ennuyeuses."</p>

<p>"Quand on veut affirmer quelque chose, on appelle toujours
Dieu &agrave; t&eacute;moin, parce qu'il ne contredit jamais."</p>

<p>"On ne peut jamais &ecirc;tre fatigu&eacute; de la vie, on n'est fatigu&eacute;
que de soi-m&ecirc;me."</p>

<p>"Il faut &ecirc;tre ou tr&egrave;s-pieux ou tr&egrave;s-philosophe! il faut
dire: Seigneur, que ta volont&eacute; soit faite! ou: Nature,
j'admets tes lois, m&ecirc;me lorsqu'elles m'&eacute;crasent."</p>

<p>"L'homme est un violon. Ce n'est que lorsque sa
derni&egrave;re corde se brise qu'il devient un morceau de bois."</p>

<p>In the recently published sketch of Madame Mohl there
are several sentences which show trenchant wit, as: "Nations
squint in looking at one another; we must discount
what Germany and France say of each other."</p>

<p>Several Englishwomen can be recalled who were noted
for their epigrammatic wit: as Harriet, Lady Ashburton.
On some one saying that liars generally speak good-naturedly
of others, she replied: "Why, if you don't speak a
word of truth, it is not so difficult to speak well of your
neighbor."</p>

<p>"Don't speak so hardly of &mdash;&mdash;," some one said to her;
"he lives on your good graces."</p>

<p>"That accounts," she answered, "for his being so thin."</p>

<p>Again: "I don't mind the canvas of a man's mind being
good, if only it is completely hidden by the worsted and
floss."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span></p>
<p>Or: "She never speaks to any one, which is, of course,
a great advantage to any one."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carlyle <i>was</i> an epigram herself&mdash;small, sweet, yet
possessing a sting&mdash;and her letters give us many sharp and
original sayings.</p>

<p>She speaks in one place of "Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, an insupportable
bore; her neck and arms were as naked as if she had
never eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil."</p>

<p>And what a comical phrase is hers when she writes to her
"Dearest"&mdash;"I take time by the <i>pig-tail</i> and write at
night, after post-hours"&mdash;that growling, surly "dearest,"
of whom she said, "The amount of bile that he brings
home is awfully grand."</p>

<p>For a veritable epigram from an American woman's pen
we must rely on Hannah F. Gould, who wrote many verses
that were rather graceful and arch than witty. But her
epitaph on her friend, the active and aggressive Caleb
Cushing, is as good as any made by Saxe.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lay aside, all ye dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For in the next bed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Reposes the body of Cushing;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He has crowded his way<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Through the world, they say,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And even though dead will be pushing."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such a hit from a bright woman is refreshing.</p>

<p>Our literary foremothers seemed to prefer to be pedantic,
didactic, and tedious on the printed page.</p>

<p>Catharine Sedgwick dealt somewhat in epigram, as when
she says: "He was not one of those convenient single people
who are used, as we use straw and cotton in packing, to
fill up vacant places."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span></p>

<p>Eliza Leslie (famed for her cook-books and her satiric
sketches), when speaking of people silent from stupidity,
supposed kindly to be full of reserved power, says: "We
cannot help thinking that when a head is full of ideas some
of them must involuntarily <i>ooze</i> out."</p>

<p>And is not this epigrammatic advice? "Avoid giving
invitations to bores&mdash;they will come without."</p>

<p>Some of our later literary women prefer the epigrammatic
form in sentences, crisp and laconic; short sayings full of
pith, of which I have made a collection.</p>

<p>Gail Hamilton's books fairly bristle with epigrams in
condensed style, and Kate Field has many a good thought
in this shape, as: "Judge no one by his relations, whatever
criticism you pass upon his companions. Relations, like
features, are thrust upon us; companions, like clothes, are
more or less our own selection."</p>

<p>Miss Jewett's style is less epigrammatic, but just as full of
humor. Speaking of a person who was always complaining,
she says: "Nothing ever suits her. She ain't had no more
troubles to bear than the rest of us; but you never see her
that she didn't have a chapter to lay before ye. I've got 's
much feelin' as the next one, but when folks drives in their
spiggits and wants to draw a bucketful o' compassion every
day right straight along, there does come times when it
seems as if the bar'l was getting low."</p>

<p>"The captain, whose eyes were not much better than his
ears, always refused to go forth after nightfall without his
lantern. The old couple steered slowly down the uneven
sidewalk toward their cousin's house. The captain walked
with a solemn, rolling gait, learned in his many long years
at sea, and his wife, who was also short and stout, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
caught the habit from him. If they kept step all went
well; but on this occasion, as sometimes happened, they
did not take the first step out into the world together, so
they swayed apart, and then bumped against each other as
they went along. To see the lantern coming through the
mist you might have thought it the light of a small craft at
sea in heavy weather."</p>

<p>"Deaf people hear more things that are worth listening
to than people with better ears; one likes to have something
worth telling in talking to a person who misses most
of the world's talk."</p>

<p>"Emory Ann," a creation of Mrs. Whitney's, often spoke
in epigrams, as: "Good looks are a snare; especially to
them that haven't got 'em." While Mrs. Walker's creed,
"I believe in the total depravity of inanimate things," is
more than an epigram&mdash;it is an inspiration.</p>

<p>Charlotte Fiske Bates, who compiled the "Cambridge
Book of Poetry," and has given us a charming volume of
her own verses, which no one runs any "Risk" in buying,
in spite of the title of the book, has done a good deal
in this direction, and is fond of giving an epigrammatic
turn to a bright thought, as in the following couplet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Would you sketch in two words a coquette and deceiver?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Name two Irish geniuses, Lover and Lever!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She also succeeds with the quatrain:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">ON BEING CALLED A GOOSE.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">A signal name is this, upon my word!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Great Juno's geese saved Rome her citadel.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Another drowsy Manlius may be stirred<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the State saved, if I but cackle well.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span></p><p>I recall a charming <i>jeu d'esprit</i> from Mrs. Barrows, the
beloved "Aunt Fanny," who writes equally well for children
and grown folks, and whose big heart ranges from
earnest philanthropy to the perpetration of exquisite nonsense.</p>

<p>It is but a trifle, sent with a couple of peanut-owls to a
niece of Bryant's. The aged poet was greatly amused.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When great Minerva chose the Owl,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That bird of solemn phiz,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That truly awful-looking fowl,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To represent her wis-<br /></span>

</div></div>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>Miss Phelps has given us some sentences which convey
an epigram in a keen and delicate fashion, as:</p>

<p>"All forms of self-pity, like Prussian blue, should be
sparingly used."</p>

<p>"As a rule, a man can't cultivate his mustache and his
talents impartially."</p>

<p>"As happy as a kind-hearted old lady with a funeral to
go to."</p>

<p>"No men are so fussy about what they eat as those who
think their brains the biggest part of them."</p>

<p>"The professor's sister, a homeless widow, of excellent
Vermont intentions and high ideals in cup-cake."</p>

<p>And this longer extract has the same characteristics:</p>

<p>"You know how it is with people, Avis; some take to
zo&ouml;logy, and some take to religion. That's the way it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>with places. It may be the Lancers, and it may be prayer-meetings.
Once I went to see my grandmother in the
country, and everybody had a candy-pull; there were
twenty-five candy-pulls and taffy-bakes in that town that
winter. John Rose says, in the Connecticut Valley, where
he came from, it was missionary barrels; and I heard of a
place where it was cold coffee. In Harmouth it's improving
your mind. And so," added Coy, "we run to reading-clubs,
and we all go fierce, winter after winter, to see
who'll get the 'severest.' There's a set outside of the
faculty that descends to charades and music and inconceivably
low intellectual depths; and some of our girls sneak
off and get in there once in a while, like the little girl that
wanted to go from heaven to hell to play Saturday afternoons,
just as you and I used to do, Avis, when we dared.
But I find I've got too old for that," said Coy, sadly.
"When you're fairly past the college-boys, and as far along
as the law students&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or the theologues?" interposed Avis.</p>

<p>"Yes, or the theologues, or even the medical department;
then there positively <i>is</i> nothing for it but to improve
your mind."</p>

<p>Listen to Lavinia, one of Mrs. Rose Terry Cooke's sensible
Yankee women:</p>

<p>"Land! if you want to know folks, just hire out to 'em.
They take their wigs off afore the help, so to speak, seemingly."</p>

<p>"Marryin' a man ain't like settin' alongside of him
nights and hearin' him talk pretty; that's the fust prayer.
There's lots an' lots o' meetin' after that!"</p>

<p>And what an amount of sense, as well as wit, in Sam
Lawson's sayings in "Old Town Folks." As this book is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
not to be as large as Worcester's Unabridged Dictionary, I
can only give room to one.</p>

<p>"We don't none of us like to have our sins set in order
afore us. There was <i>David</i>, now, he was crank as could
be when he thought Nathan was a talkin' about <i>other</i> people's
sins. Says David: 'The man that did that shall
surely die.' But come to set it home and say, '<i>Thou</i> art the
man!' David caved right in. 'Lordy massy, bless your
soul and body, Nathan!' says he, 'I don't want to die.'"</p>

<p>And Mrs. A.D.T. Whitney must not be forgotten. "As
Emory Ann said once about thoughts: 'You can't hinder
'em any more than you can the birds that fly in the air; but
you needn't let 'em light and make a nest in your hair.'"</p>

<p>And what a capital hit on the hypocritical apologies of
conceited housekeepers is this bit from Mrs. Whicher
("Widow Bedott"): "A person that didn't know how
wimmin always go on at such a place would a thought that
Miss Gipson had tried to have everything the miserablest
she possibly could, and that the rest on 'em never had anything
to hum but what was miserabler yet."</p>

<p>And Marietta Holley, who has caused a tidal-wave of
laughter by her "Josiah Allen's Wife" series, shall have
her say.</p>

<p>"We, too, are posterity, though mebby we don't realize
it as we ort to."</p>

<p>"She didn't seem to sense anything, only ruffles and
such like. Her mind all seemed to be narrowed down and
puckered up, just like trimmin'."</p>

<p>But I must have convinced the most sceptical of woman's
wit in epigrammatic form, and will now return to an older
generation, who claim a fair share of attention.</p>

<p class="center">HUMOR OF LITERARY ENGLISHWOMEN.</p>

<p>In reviewing the <i>bon-mots</i> of Stella, whom Swift pronounced
the most witty woman he had ever known, it
seems that we are improving. I will give but two of her
sayings, which were so carefully preserved by her friend.</p>

<p>When she was extremely ill her physician said,
"Madam, you are near the bottom of the hill, but we will
endeavor to get you up again;" she answered: "Doctor, I
fear I shall be out of breath before I get up to the top."</p>

<p>After she had been eating some sweet thing a little of it
happened to stick on her lips. A gentleman told her of it,
and offered to lick it off. She said: "No, sir, I thank
you; I have a tongue of my own."</p>

<p>Compare these with the wit of George Eliot or the irony
of Miss Phelps.</p>

<p>Some of Jane Taylor's stories and poems were formerly
regarded as humorous; for instance, the "Discontented
Pendulum" and the "Philosopher's Scales." They do
not now raise the faintest smile.</p>

<p>Fanny Burney's novels were considered immensely
humorous and diverting in their day. Burke complimented
her on "her natural vein of humor," and another eminent
critic speaks of "her sarcasm, drollery, and humor;" but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>it would be almost impossible to find a passage for quotation
that would now satisfy on these points. Even Jane
Austen's novels, which strangely retain their hold on the
public taste, are tedious to those who dare to think for
themselves and forget Macaulay's verdict.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barbauld, in her poem on "Washing Day," shows
a capacity seldom exercised for seeing the humorous side of
every-day miseries.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"Woe to the friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose evil stars have urged him forth to claim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On such a day the hospitable rites!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looks, blank at best, and stinted courtesy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall he receive. Vainly he feeds his hopes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dinner of roast chicken, savory pie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or tart, or pudding; pudding he nor tart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That day shall eat; nor, though the husband try<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mending what can't be helped to kindle mirth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From cheer deficient, shall his consort's brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cheer up propitious; the unlucky guest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In silence dines, and early slinks away."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But her style is too stiff and stately for every day.</p>

<p>There were many literary Englishwomen who had undoubted
humor. Hannah More did get unendurably poky,
narrow, and solemn in her last days, and not a little sanctimonious;
and we naturally think of her as an aged spinster
with black mitts, corkscrew curls, and a mob cap, always
writing or presenting a tedious tract, forgetting her brilliant
youth, when she was quite good enough, and lively, too.
She was a perennial favorite in London, meeting all the
notables; the special pet of Dr. Johnson, Davy Garrick,
and Horace Walpole, who called her his "holy Hannah,"
but admired and honored her, corresponding with her
through a long life. She was then full of spirit and humor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
and versatile talent. An extract from her sister's lively
letter shows that Hannah could hold her own with the Ursa
Major of literature:</p>

<p>"Tuesday evening we drank tea at Sir Joshua's with
Dr. Johnson. Hannah is certainly a great favorite. She
was placed next him, and they had the entire conversation
to themselves. They were both in remarkably high spirits.
It was certainly her lucky night. I never heard her say so
many good things. The old genius was extremely jocular,
and the young one very pleasant. You would have imagined
we had been at some comedy had you heard our peals of
laughter. They, indeed, tried which could pepper the highest,
and it is not clear to me that the lexicographer was really
the highest seasoner."</p>

<p>And how deliciously does she set out the absurdity then
prevailing, and seen now in editions of Shakespeare and
Chaucer, of writing books, the bulk of which consists of
notes, with only a line or two at the top of each page of the
original text.</p>

<p>It seems that a merry party at Dr. Kennicott's had each
adopted the name of some animal. Dr. K. was the elephant;
Mrs. K., dromedary; Miss Adams, antelope; and
H. More, rhinoceros.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<span style="margin-left: 13.5em;">"<span class="smcap">Hampton</span>, December 24, 1728.</span><br />

<p>The following notes on the above epistle are by a commentator
of the latter end of the nineteenth century. This
epistle is all that is come down to us of this voluminous
author, and is probably the only thing she ever wrote that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
was worth preserving, or which might reasonably expect to
reach posterity. Her name is only presented to us in some
beautiful hendecasyllables written by the best Latin poet
of his time (Bishop Lowth):</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center"><i>Note</i> (<i>a</i>).</p>

<p>"<i>Dromy.</i>&mdash;From the termination of this address it seems to have been
written to a woman, though there is no internal evidence to support this
hypothesis. The best critics are much puzzled about the orthography of
this abbreviation. Wartonius and other skilful etymologists contend
that it ought to be spelled <i>drummy</i>, being addressed to a lady who was
probably fond of warlike instruments, and who had a singular predilection
for a <i>canon</i>. Drummy, say they, was a tender diminutive of drum,
as the best authors in their more familiar writings now begin to use
gunny for gun. But <i>Hardius</i>, a contemporary critic, contends, with
more probability, that it ought to be written <i>Drome</i>, from hippodrome;
a learned leech and elegant bard of Bath having left it on record that
this lady spent much of her time at the riding-school, being a very exquisite
judge of horsemanship. <i>Colmanus</i> and <i>Horatius Strawberryensis</i>
insist that it ought to be written <i>Dromo</i>, in reference to the Dromo Sorasius
of the Latin dramatist."</p>

<p class="center"><i>Note</i> (<i>b</i>).</p>

<p>"<i>Ante.</i>&mdash;Scaliger 2d says this name simply signifies the appellation of
uncle's wife, and ought to be written <i>Aunty</i>. But here, again, are various
readings. Philologists of yet greater name affirm that it was meant to
designate <i>pre-eminence</i>, and therefore ought to be written <i>ante</i>, before,
from the Latin, a language now pretty well forgotten, though the authors
who wrote in it are still preserved in French translations. The younger
Madame Dacier insists that this lady was against all men, and that it
ought to be spelled <i>anti</i>; but this Kennicotus, a rabbi of the most recondite
learning, with much critical wrath, vehemently contradicts, affirming
it to have been impossible she could have been against mankind
whom all mankind admired. He adds that ante is for <i>antelope</i>, and is
emblematically used to express an elegant and slender animal, or that it
is an elongation of <i>ant</i>, the <i>emblem of virtuous citizenship</i>."</p></div>

<p>And so she continues her comments to close of notes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span></p>
<p>Mrs. Gaskell's "Cranford" is full of the most delicate
but veritable humor, as her allusion to the genteel and
cheerful poverty of the lady who, in giving a tea-party,
"now sat in state, pretending not to know what cakes were
sent up, though she knew, and we knew, and she knew that
we knew; and we knew that she knew that we knew she
had been busy all the morning making tea-bread and
sponge-cakes."</p>

<p>The humor of Mary Russell Mitford, quiet and delectable,
must not be forgotten. We will sympathize with her woes
as she describes a visitation from</p>

<h3>THE TALKING LADY.</h3>

<p>"Ben Jonson has a play called <i>The Silent Woman</i>, who
turns out, as might be expected, to be no woman at all&mdash;nothing,
as Master Slender said, but 'a great lubberly boy,'
thereby, as I apprehend, discourteously presuming that a
silent woman is a nonentity. If the learned dramatist, thus
happily prepared and predisposed, had happened to fall in
with such a specimen of female loquacity as I have just
parted with, he might, perhaps, have given us a pendant to
his picture in the talking lady. Pity but he had! He
would have done her justice, which I could not at any
time, least of all now; I am too much stunned, too much
like one escaped from a belfry on a coronation day. I am
just resting from the fatigue of four days' hard listening&mdash;four
snowy, sleety, rainy days; days of every variety of
falling weather, all of them too bad to admit the possibility
that any petticoated thing, were she as hardy as a Scotch
fir, should stir out; four days chained by 'sad civility' to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>that fireside, once so quiet, and again&mdash;cheering thought!&mdash;again
I trust to be so when the echo of that visitor's incessant
tongue shall have died away....</p>

<p>"She took us in her way from London to the west of
England, and being, as she wrote, 'not quite well, not
equal to much company, prayed that no other guest might
be admitted, so that she might have the pleasure of our
conversation all to herself (<i>ours!</i> as if it were possible for
any of us to slide in a word edgewise!), and especially
enjoy the gratification of talking over old times with the
master of the house, her countryman.'</p>

<p>"Such was the promise of her letter, and to the letter it
has been kept. All the news and scandal of a large county
forty years ago, and a hundred years before, and ever
since; all the marriages, deaths, births, elopements, law-suits,
and casualties of her own times, her father's, grandfather's,
great-grandfather's, nephews', and grandnephews',
has she detailed with a minuteness, an accuracy, a prodigality
of learning, a profuseness of proper names, a pedantry
of locality, which would excite the envy of a county historian,
a king-at-arms, or even a Scotch novelist.</p>

<p>"Her knowledge is most astonishing; but the most
astonishing part of all is how she came by that knowledge.
It should seem, to listen to her, as if at some time of her
life she must have listened herself; and yet her countryman
declares that in the forty years he has known her, no such
event has occurred; and she knows new news, too! It
must be intuition!...</p>

<p>"The very weather is not a safe subject. Her memory
is a perpetual register of hard frosts and long droughts, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>high winds and terrible storms, with all the evils that followed
in their train, and all the personal events connected
with them; so that, if you happen to remark that clouds
are come up and you fear it may rain, she replies: 'Ay, it
is just such a morning as three-and-thirty years ago, when
my poor cousin was married&mdash;you remember my cousin
Barbara; she married so-and-so, the son of so-and-so;' and
then comes the whole pedigree of the bridegroom, the
amount of the settlements, and the reading and signing
them overnight; a description of the wedding-dresses in
the style of Sir Charles Grandison, and how much the
bride's gown cost per yard; the names, residences, and a
short subsequent history of the bridesmaids and men, the
gentleman who gave the bride away, and the clergyman
who performed the ceremony, with a learned antiquarian
digression relative to the church; then the setting out in
procession; the marriage, the kissing, the crying, the breakfasting,
the drawing the cake through the ring, and, finally,
the bridal excursion, which brings us back again, at an hour's
end, to the starting-post, the weather, and the whole story
of the sopping, the drying, the clothes-spoiling, the cold-catching,
and all the small evils of a summer shower. By
this time it rains, and she sits down to a pathetic see-saw of
conjectures on the chance of Mrs. Smith's having set out
for her daily walk, or the possibility that Dr. Brown may
have ventured to visit his patients in his gig, and the certainty
that Lady Green's new housemaid would come from
London on the outside of the coach....</p>

<p>"I wonder, if she had happened to be married, how
many husbands she would have talked to death. It is certain
that none of her relatives are long-lived, after she
comes to reside with them. Father, mother, uncle, sister,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>brother, two nephews, and one niece, all these have successively
passed away, though a healthy race, and with no
visible disorder&mdash;except&mdash;But we must not be uncharitable."</p>

<p>Mary Ferrier, the Scotch novelist, was gifted with genial
wit and a quick sense of the ludicrous. Walter Scott admired
her greatly, and as a lively guest at Abbotsford she
did much to relieve the sadness of his last days. He said
of her:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"She is a gifted personage, having, besides her great
talents, conversation the least <i>exigeante</i> of any author,
female at least, whom I have ever seen, among the long list
I have encountered. Simple and full of humor, and exceedingly
ready at repartee; and all this without the least
affectation of the blue-stocking. The general strain of her
writing relates to the foibles and oddities of mankind, and
no one has drawn them with greater breadth of comic
humor or effect. Her scenes often resemble the style of our
best old comedies, and she may boast, like Foote, of adding
many new and original characters to the stock of our comic
literature."</p></div>

<p>Here is one of her admirably-drawn portraits:</p>

<h3>THE SENSIBLE WOMAN.</h3>

<p>"Miss Jacky, the senior of the trio, was what is reckoned
a very sensible woman&mdash;which generally means a very
disagreeable, obstinate, illiberal director of all men, women,
and children&mdash;a sort of superintendent of all actions, time,
and place, with unquestioned authority to arraign, judge,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>and condemn upon the statutes of her own supposed sense.
Most country parishes have their sensible woman, who lays
down the law on all affairs, spiritual and temporal. Miss
Jacky stood unrivalled as the sensible woman of Glenfern.
She had attained this eminence partly from having a little
more understanding than her sisters, but principally from
her dictatorial manner, and the pompous, decisive tone in
which she delivered the most commonplace truths. At
home her supremacy in all matters of sense was perfectly
established; and thence the infection, like other superstitions,
had spread over the whole neighborhood. As a
sensible woman she regulated the family, which she took
care to let everybody hear; she was a sort of postmistress-general,
a detector of all abuses and impositions, and deemed
it her prerogative to be consulted about all the useful and
useless things which everybody else could have done as well.
She was liberal of her advice to the poor, always enforcing
upon them the iniquity of idleness, but doing nothing for
them in the way of employment, strict economy being one
of the many points in which she was particularly sensible.
The consequence was that, while she was lecturing half the
poor women in the parish for their idleness, the bread was
kept out of their mouths by the incessant carding of wool,
and knitting of stockings, and spinning, and reeling, and
winding, and pirning, that went on among the ladies themselves.
And, by the by, Miss Jacky is not the only sensible
woman who thinks she is acting a meritorious part when
she converts what ought to be the portion of the poor into
the employment of the affluent.</p>

<p>"In short, Min Jacky was all over sense. A skilful
physiognomist would at a single glance have detected the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>sensible woman in the erect head, the compressed lips,
square elbows, and firm, judicious step. Even her very
garments seemed to partake of the prevailing character of
their mistress. Her ruff always looked more sensible than
any other body's; her shawl sat most sensibly on her shoulders;
her walking-shoes were acknowledged to be very
sensible, and she drew on her gloves with an air of sense, as
if the one arm had been Seneca, the other Socrates. From
what has been said it may easily be inferred that Miss Jacky
was, in fact, anything but a sensible woman, as, indeed, no
woman can be who bears such visible outward marks of
what is in reality the most quiet and unostentatious of all
good qualities."</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>Frederika Bremer, the Swedish novelist, whose novels
have been translated into English, German, French, and
Dutch, had a style peculiarly her own. Her humor reminds
me of a bed of mignonette, with its delicate yet permeating
fragrance. One paragraph, like one spray of that shy
flower, scarcely reveals the dainty flavor.</p>

<p>From the "Neighbors," her best story, and one that still
has a moderate sale, I take her description of Franziska's
first little lover-like quarrel with her adoring husband, the
"Bear." (Let us remember Miss Bremer with appreciation
and gratitude, as one of the very few visitors we have entertained
who have written kindly of our country and our
"Homes.")</p>

<h3>THE FIRST QUARREL.</h3>

<p>"Here I am again sitting with a pen in my hand, impelled
by a desire for writing, yet with nothing particular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>to write about. Everything in the house and in the whole
household arrangement is in order. Little patties are baking
in the kitchen, the weather is oppressively hot, and
every leaf and bird seem as if deprived of motion. The
hens lie outside in the sand before the window, the cock
stands solitarily on one leg, and looks upon his harem with
the countenance of a sleepy sultan. Bear sits in his room
writing letters. I hear him yawn; that infects me. Oh!
oh! I must go and have a little quarrel with him on purpose
to awaken us both.</p>

<p>"I want at this moment a quire of writing-paper on
which to drop sugar-cakes. He is terribly miserly of his
writing-paper, and on that very account I must have some
now.</p>

<p>"<i>Later.</i>&mdash;All is done! A complete quarrel, and how
completely lively we are after it! You, Maria, must hear
all, that you may thus see how it goes on among married
people.</p>

<p>"I went to my husband and said quite meekly, 'My
Angel Bear, you must be so very good as to give me a quire
of your writing-paper to drop sugar-cakes upon.'</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> (<i>in consternation</i>). 'A quire of writing-paper?'</p>

<p>"<i>She.</i> 'Yes, my dear friend, of your very best writing-paper.'</p>

<p>"<i>He.</i> 'Finest writing-paper? Are you mad?'</p>

<p>"<i>She.</i> 'Certainly not; but I believe you are a little out
of your senses.'</p>

<p>"<i>He.</i> 'You covetous sea-cat, leave off raging among my
papers! You shall not have my paper!'</p>

<p>"<i>She.</i> 'Miserly beast! I shall and will have the paper.'</p>

<p>"<i>He.</i> '"I shall"! Listen a moment. Let's see, now,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>how you will accomplish your will.' And the rough Bear
held both my small hands fast in his great paws.</p>

<p>"<i>She.</i> 'You ugly Bear! You are worse than any of
those that walk on four legs. Let me loose! Let me
loose, else I shall bite you!' And as he would not let me
loose I bit him. Yes, Maria, I bit him really on the hand,
at which he only laughed scornfully and said: 'Yes, yes,
my little wife, that is always the way of those who are forward
without the power to do. Take the paper. Now,
take it!'</p>

<p>"<i>She.</i> 'Ah! Let me loose! let me loose!'</p>

<p>"<i>He.</i> 'Ask me prettily.'</p>

<p>"<i>She.</i> 'Dear Bear!'</p>

<p>"<i>He.</i> 'Acknowledge your fault.'</p>

<p>"<i>She.</i> 'I do.'</p>

<p>"<i>He.</i> 'Pray for forgiveness.'</p>

<p>"<i>She.</i> 'Ah, forgiveness!'</p>

<p>"<i>He..</i> 'Promise amendment.'</p>

<p>"<i>She.</i> 'Oh, yes, amendment!'</p>

<p>"<i>He.</i> 'Nay, I'll pardon you. But now, no sour faces,
dear wife, but throw your arms round my neck and kiss me.'</p>

<p>"I gave him a little box on the ear, stole a quire of
paper, and ran off with loud exultation. Bear followed into
the kitchen growling horribly; but then I turned upon him
armed with two delicious little patties, which I aimed at his
mouth, and there they vanished. Bear, all at once, was
quite still, the paper was forgotten, and reconciliation concluded.</p>

<p>"There is, Maria, no better way of stopping the mouths
of these lords of the creation than by putting into them
something good to eat."</p>

<p>From George Eliot, whose humor is seen at its best in
"Adam Bede" and "Silas Marner," how much we could
quote! How some of her searching comments cling to the
memory!</p>

<p>"I've nothing to say again' her piety, my dear; but I
know very well I shouldn't like her to cook my victuals.
When a man comes in hungry and tired, piety won't feed
him, I reckon. Hard carrots 'ull lie heavy on his stomach,
piety or no piety. I called in one day when she was dishin'
up Mr. Tryan's dinner, an' I could see the potatoes was
as watery as watery. It's right enough to be speritial, I'm
no enemy to that, but I like my potatoes mealy."</p>

<p>"You're right there, Tookey; there's allays two 'pinions:
there's the 'pinion a man has of himsen, and there's
the 'pinion other folks have on him. There'd be two 'pinions
about a cracked bell if the bell could hear itself."</p>

<p>"You're mighty fond o' Craig; but for my part, I think
he's welly like a cock as thinks the sun's rose o' purpose to
hear him crow."</p>

<p>"When Mr. Brooke had something painful to tell it was
usually his way to introduce it among a number of disjointed
particulars, as if it were a medicine that would get
a milder flavor by mixing."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span></p>
<p>"Heaven knows what would become of our sociality if
we never visited people we speak ill of; we should live like
Egyptian hermits, in crowded solitude."</p>

<p>"No, I ain't one to see the cat walking into the dairy
and wonder what she's come after."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to say again' Craig, on'y it is a pity he
couldna be hatched o'er again, and hatched different."</p>

<p>"I'm not denyin' the women are foolish; God Almighty
made 'em to match the men."</p>

<p>"It's a waste of time to praise people dead whom you
maligned while living; for it's but a poor harvest you'll
get by watering last year's crop."</p>

<p>"I suppose Dinah's like all the rest of the women, and
thinks two and two will come to make five, if she only cries
and makes bother enough about it."</p>

<p>"Put a good face on it and don't seem to be looking out
for crows, else you'll set other people to watchin' for 'em,
too."</p>

<p>"I took pretty good care, before I said 'sniff,' to be sure
she would say 'snaff,' and pretty quick, too. I warn't
a-goin' to open my mouth like a dog at a fly, and snap it to
again wi' nothin' to swaller."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="center">FROM ANNE BRADSTREET TO MRS. STOWE.</p>

<p>The same gratifying progress and improvement noticed
in the wit of women of other lands is seen in studying the
literary annals of our own countrywomen.</p>

<p>Think of Anne Bradstreet, Mercy Warren, and Tabitha
Tenney, all extolled to the skies by their contemporaries.</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>Mercy Warren was a satirist quite in the strain of Juvenal,
but in cumbrous, artificial fashion.</p>

<p>Hon. John Winthrop consulted her on the proposed suspension
of trade with England in all but the <i>necessaries</i> of
life, and she playfully gives a list of articles that would be
included in that word:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"An inventory clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all she needs Lamira offers here;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor does she fear a rigid Cato's frown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When she lays by the rich embroidered gown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And modestly compounds for just enough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps some dozens of mere flighty stuff;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With lawns and lute strings, blonde and Mechlin laces,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fringes and jewels, fans and tweezer-cases;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gay cloaks and hat, of every shape and size,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarfs, cardinals, and ribands, of all dyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ruffles stamped and aprons of tambour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tippets and handkerchiefs, at least threescore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With finest muslins that fair India boasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the choice herbage from Chinesian coasts;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span><span class="i0">Add feathers, furs, rich satin, and ducapes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And head-dresses in pyramidal shapes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sideboards of plate and porcelain profuse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fifty dittoes that the ladies use.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So weak Lamira and her wants so few<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who can refuse? they're but the sex's due."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>Mrs. Sigourney, voluminous and mediocre, is amusing
because so absolutely destitute of humor, and her style, a
feminine <i>Johnsonese</i>, is absurdly hifalutin and strained.</p>

<p>This is the way in which she alludes to green apples:</p>

<p>"From the time of their first taking on orbicular shape,
and when it might be supposed their hardness and acidity
would repulse all save elephantine tusks and ostrich stomachs,
they were the prey of roaming children."</p>

<p>And in her poem "To a Shred of Linen":</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">"Methinks I scan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some idiosyncrasy that marks thee out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A defunct pillow-case."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She preserved, however, a long list of the various solicitations
sent her to furnish poems for special occasions, and I
think this shows that she possessed a sense of humor. Let
me quote a few:</p>

<p>"Some verses were desired as an elegy on a pet canary
accidentally drowned in a barrel of swine's food.</p>

<p>"A poem requested on the dog-star Sirius.</p>

<p>"To write an ode for the wedding of people in Maine,
of whom I had never heard.</p>

<p>"To punctuate a three-volume novel for an author who
complained that the work of punctuating always brought
on a pain in the small of his back.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span></p>
<p>"Asked to assist a servant-man not very well able to read
in getting his Sunday-school lessons, and to write out all
the answers for him clear through the book&mdash;to save his
time.</p>

<p>"A lady whose husband expects to be absent on a journey
for a month or two wishes I would write a poem to
testify her joy at his return.</p>

<p>"An elegy on a young man, one of the nine children of
a judge of probate."</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>Miss Sedgwick, in her letters, occasionally showed a keen
sense of humor, as, when speaking of a certain novel, she
said:</p>

<p>"There is too much force for the subject. It is as if a
railroad should be built and a locomotive started to transport
skeletons, specimens, and one bird of Paradise."</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>Mrs. Caroline Gilman, born in 1794, and still living,
author of "Recollections of a Southern Matron," etc., will
be represented by one playful poem, which has a veritable
New England flavor:</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>"Fanny Forrester" and "Fanny Fern" both delighted
the public with individual styles of writing, vastly successful
when a new thing.</p>

<p>When wanting a new dress and bonnet, as every woman
will in the spring (or any time), Fanny Forrester wrote to
Willis, of the <i>New Mirror</i>, an appeal which he called
"very clever, adroit, and fanciful."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"You know the shops in Broadway are very tempting
this season. <i>Such</i> beautiful things! Well, you know
(no, you don't know that, but you can guess) what a delightful
thing it would be to appear in one of those
charming, head-adorning, complexion-softening, hard-feature-subduing
Neapolitans, with a little gossamer veil dropping
daintily on the shoulder of one of those exquisite <i>balzarines</i>,
to be seen any day at Stewart's and elsewhere.
Well, you know (this you <i>must</i> know) that shopkeepers
have the impertinence to demand a trifling exchange for
these things, even of a lady; and also that some people
have a remarkably small purse, and a remarkably small
portion of the yellow "root" in that. And now, to bring
the matter home, I am one of that class. I have the
most beautiful little purse in the world, but it is only kept
for show. I even find myself under the necessity of counterfeiting&mdash;that
is, filling the void with tissue-paper in lieu
of bank-notes, preparatory to a shopping expedition. Well,
now to the point. As Bel and I snuggled down on the sofa
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>this morning to read the <i>New Mirror</i> (by the way, Cousin
Bel is never obliged to put tissue-paper in her purse), it
struck us that you would be a friend in need, and give good
counsel in this emergency. Bel, however, insisted on my
not telling what I wanted the money for. She even
thought that I had better intimate orphanage, extreme
suffering from the bursting of some speculative bubble,
illness, etc.; but did I not know you better? Have I read
the <i>New Mirror</i> so much (to say nothing of the graceful
things coined under a bridge, and a thousand other pages
flung from the inner heart) and not learned who has an eye
for everything pretty? Not so stupid, Cousin Bel, no,
no!...</p>

<p>"And to the point. Maybe you of the <i>New Mirror</i>
PAY for acceptable articles, maybe not. <i>Comprenez
vous?</i> Oh, I do hope that beautiful <i>balzarine</i> like Bel's
will not be gone before another Saturday! You will not
forget to answer me in the next <i>Mirror</i>; but pray, my
dear Editor, let it be done very cautiously, for Bel would
pout all day if she should know what I have written.</p>

<p>"Till Saturday, your anxiously-waiting friend,</p></div>

<p class="p3">"Fanny Forrester."</p>

<p>Such a note received by an editor of this generation
would promptly fall into the waste-basket. But Willis was
captivated, and answered:</p>

<p>"Well, we give in! On <i>condition</i> that you are under
twenty-five and that you will wear a rose (recognizably) in
your bodice the first time you appear in Broadway with the
hat and <i>balzarine</i>, we will pay the bills. Write us thereafter
a sketch of Bel and yourself as cleverly done as this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>letter, and you may 'snuggle' down on the sofa and consider
us paid, and the public charmed with you."</p>

<p>This style of ingratiating one's self with an editor is as
much a bygone as an alliterative pen-name.</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>Fanny Fern (Sarah Willis Parton) also established a style
of her own&mdash;"a new kind of composition; short, pointed
paragraphs, without beginning and without end&mdash;one clear,
ringing note, and then silence."</p>

<p>Her talent for humorous composition showed itself in her
essays at school. I'll give a bit from her "Suggestions on
Arithmetic after Cramming for an Examination":</p>

<p>"Every incident, every object of sight seemed to produce
an arithmetical result. I once saw a poor wretch evidently
intoxicated; thought I, 'That man has overcome
three scruples, to say the least, for three scruples make one
dram.' Even the Sabbath was no day of rest for me&mdash;the
psalms, prayers, and sermons were all translated by me into
the language of arithmetic. A good man spoke very feelingly
upon the manner in which our cares and perplexities
were multiplied by riches. Muttered I: 'That, sir, depends
upon whether the multiplier is a fraction or a whole
number; for if it be a fraction, it makes the product less.'
And when another, lamenting the various divisions of the
Church, pathetically exclaimed: 'And how shall we unite
these several denominations in one?'</p>

<p>"'Why, reduce them to a common denominator,' exclaimed
I, half aloud, wondering at his ignorance.</p>

<p>"And when an admiring swain protested his warm 'interest,'
he brought only one word that chimed with my
train of thought.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span></p>
<p>"'Interest?' exclaimed I, starting from my reverie.
'What per cent, sir?'</p>

<p>"'Ma'am?' exclaimed my attendant, in the greatest
possible amazement.</p>

<p>"'How much per cent, sir?' said I, repeating my question.</p>

<p>"His reply was lost on my ear save: 'Madam, at any
rate do not trifle with my feelings.'</p>

<p>"'At any rate, did you say? Then take six per cent;
that is the easiest to calculate.'"</p>

<p>Her style, too, has gone out of fashion; but in its day it
was thought very amusing.</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>Mrs. Stowe needs no introduction, and she is another of
those from whom we quote little, because she could contribute
so much, and one does not know where to choose.
Her "Sam Lawson" is, perhaps, the most familiar of her
odd characters and talkers.</p>

<h3>SAM LAWSON'S SAYINGS.</h3>

<p>"Well, Sam, what did you think of the sermon?" said
Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>"Well," said Sam, leaning over the fire with his long,
bony hands alternately raised to catch the warmth, and then
dropped with an utter laxness when the warmth became too
pronounced, "Parson Simpson's a smart man; but I tell
ye, it's kind o' discouragin'. Why, he said our state and
condition by natur war just like this: We war clear down
in a well fifty feet deep, and the sides all round nothin' but
glare ice; but we war under immediate obligations to get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
out, 'cause we war free, voluntary agents. But nobody ever
had got out, and nobody would, unless the Lord reached
down and took 'em. And whether he would or not nobody
could tell; it was all sovereignty. He said there warn't
one in a hundred, not one in a thousand, not one in ten
thousand, that would be saved. 'Lordy massy,' says I to
myself, 'ef that's so they're any of 'em welcome to my
chance.' And so I kind o' ris up and come out, 'cause
I'd got a pretty long walk home, and I wanted to go round
by South Pond and inquire about Aunt Sally Morse's
toothache." ...</p>

<p>"This 'ere Miss Sphyxy Smith's a rich old gal, and
'mazin' smart to work," he began. "Tell you, she holds
all she gets. Old Sol, he told me a story 'bout her that
was a pretty good un."</p>

<p>"What was it?" said my grandmother.</p>

<p>"Wal, ye see, you 'member old Parson Jeduthun Kendall
that lives up in Stonytown; he lost his wife a year ago
last Thanksgivin', and he thought 'twar about time he hed
another; so he comes down and consults our Parson
Lothrop. Says he: 'I want a good, smart, neat, economical
woman, with a good property. I don't care nothin'
about her bein' handsome. In fact, I ain't particular
about anything else,' says he. Wal, Parson Lothrop, says
he: 'I think, if that's the case, I know jest the woman to
suit ye. She owns a clear, handsome property, and she's
neat and economical; but she's no beauty!' 'Oh, beauty
is nothin' to me,' says Parson Kendall; and so he took the
direction. Wal, one day he hitched up his old one-hoss
shay, and kind o' brushed up, and started off a-courtin'.
Wal, the parson come to the house, and he war tickled to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>pieces with the looks o' things outside, 'cause the house is
all well shingled and painted, and there ain't a picket loose
nor a nail wantin' nowhere.</p>

<p>"'This 'ere's the woman for me,' says Parson Kendall.
So he goes up and raps hard on the front door with his
whip-handle. Wal, you see, Miss Sphyxy she war jest
goin' out to help get in her hay. She had on a pair o'
clompin' cowhide boots, and a pitchfork in her hand, jest
goin' out, when she heard the rap. So she come jest as she
was to the front door. Now, you know Parson Kendall's a
little midget of a man, but he stood there on the step kind
o' smilin' and genteel, lickin' his lips and lookin' <i>so</i> agreeable!
Wal, the front door kind o' stuck&mdash;front doors generally
do, ye know, 'cause they ain't opened very often&mdash;and
Miss Sphyxy she had to pull and haul and put to all
her strength, and finally it come open with a bang, and she
'peared to the parson, pitchfork and all, sort o' frownin'
like.</p>

<p>"'What do you want?' says she; for, you see, Miss
Sphyxy ain't no ways tender to the men.</p>

<p>"'I want to see Miss Asphyxia Smith,' says he, very
civil, thinking she war the hired gal.</p>

<p>"'I'm Miss Asphyxia Smith,' says she. 'What do you
want o' me?'</p>

<p>"Parson Kendall he jest took one good look on her,
from top to toe. '<span class="smcap">Nothin'</span>,' says he, and turned right
round and went down the steps like lightnin'."</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>Years ago Mrs. Stowe published some capital stories of
New England life, which were collected in a little volume
called "The Mayflower," a book which is now seldom seen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>and almost unknown to the present generation. From this I
take her "Night in a Canal-Boat." Extremely effective
when read with enthusiasm and proper variety of tone.
I quote it as a boon for the boys and girls who are often
looking for something "funny" to read aloud.</p>

<h3>THE CANAL-BOAT.</h3>

<p class="center">BY HARRIET BEECHER STOWE.</p>

<p>Of all the ways of travelling which obtain among our
locomotive nation, this said vehicle, the canal-boat, is the
most absolutely prosaic and inglorious. There is something
picturesque, nay, almost sublime, in the lordly march of
your well-built, high-bred steamboat. Go take your stand
on some overhanging bluff, where the blue Ohio winds its
thread of silver, or the sturdy Mississippi tears its path
through unbroken forests, and it will do your heart good to
see the gallant boat walking the waters with unbroken and
powerful tread, and, like some fabled monster of the wave,
breathing fire and making the shores resound with its deep
respirations. Then there is something mysterious&mdash;even
awful&mdash;in the power of steam. See it curling up against a
blue sky some rosy morning, graceful, floating, intangible,
and to all appearance the softest and gentlest of all spiritual
things, and then think that it is this fairy spirit that keeps
all the world alive and hot with motion; think how excellent
a servant it is, doing all sorts of gigantic works, like
the genii of old; and yet, if you let slip the talisman only
for a moment, what terrible advantage it will take of you!
and you will confess that steam has some claims both to the
beautiful and the terrible! For our own part, when we are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>down among the machinery of a steamboat in full play, we
conduct ourselves very reverently, for we consider it as
a very serious neighborhood, and every time the steam
whizzes with such red-hot determination from the escape-valve,
we start as if some of the spirits were after us. But
in a canal-boat there is no power, no mystery, no danger;
one cannot blow up, one cannot be drowned&mdash;unless by
some special effort; one sees clearly all there is in the
case&mdash;a horse, a rope, and a muddy strip of water&mdash;and
that is all.</p>

<p>Did you ever try it, reader? If not, take an imaginary
trip with us, just for experiment. "There's the boat!"
exclaims a passenger in the omnibus, as we are rolling
down from the Pittsburg Mansion House to the canal.
"Where?" exclaim a dozen of voices, and forthwith a
dozen heads go out of the window. "Why, down there,
under that bridge; don't you see those lights?" "What,
that little thing!" exclaims an inexperienced traveller;
"dear me! we can't half of us get into it!" "We! indeed,"
says some old hand in the business; "I think you'll
find it will hold us and a dozen more loads like us." "Impossible!"
say some. "You'll see," say the initiated; and
as soon as you get out you <i>do</i> see, and hear, too, what seems
like a general breaking loose from the Tower of Babel,
amid a perfect hail-storm of trunks, boxes, valises, carpet-bags,
and every describable and indescribable form of what
a Westerner calls "plunder."</p>

<p>"That's my trunk!" barks out a big, round man.
"That's my bandbox!" screams a heart-stricken old lady,
in terror for her immaculate Sunday caps. "Where's my
little red box? I had two carpet-bags and a&mdash;My trunk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>had a scarle&mdash;Halloo! where are you going with that
portmanteau? Husband! Husband! do see after the
large basket and the little hair-trunk&mdash;Oh, and the
baby's little chair!" "Go below, go below, for mercy's
sake, my dear; I'll see to the baggage." At last the feminine
part of creation, perceiving that, in this particular instance,
they gain nothing by public speaking, are content
to be led quietly under hatches; and amusing is the look of
dismay which each new-comer gives to the confined quarters
that present themselves. Those who were so ignorant
of the power of compression as to suppose the boat scarce
large enough to contain them and theirs, find, with dismay,
a respectable colony of old ladies, babies, mothers, big
baskets, and carpet-bags already established. "Mercy on
us!" says one, after surveying the little room, about ten
feet long and six feet high, "where are we all to sleep to-night?"
"Oh, me, what a sight of children!" says a
young lady, in a despairing tone. "Pooh!" says an initiated
traveller, "children! scarce any here; let's see: one;
the woman in the corner, two; that child with the bread
and butter, three; and then there's that other woman with
two. Really, it's quite moderate for a canal-boat. However,
we can't tell till they have all come."</p>

<p>"All! for mercy's sake, you don't say there are any
more coming!" exclaim two or three in a breath; "they
<i>can't</i> come; <i>there is not room</i>!"</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the impressive utterance of this sentence
the contrary is immediately demonstrated by the appearance
of a very corpulent elderly lady with three well-grown
daughters, who come down looking about them most complacently,
entirely regardless of the unchristian looks of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
company. What a mercy it is that fat people are always
good-natured!</p>

<p>After this follows an indiscriminate raining down of all
shapes, sizes, sexes, and ages&mdash;men, women, children,
babies, and nurses. The state of feeling becomes perfectly
desperate. Darkness gathers on all faces. "We shall be
smothered! we shall be crowded to death! we <i>can't stay</i>
here!" are heard faintly from one and another; and yet,
though the boat grows no wider, the walls no higher, they
do live, and do stay there, in spite of repeated protestations
to the contrary. Truly, as Sam Slick says, "there's a <i>sight
of wear</i> in human natur'!"</p>

<p>But meanwhile the children grow sleepy, and divers interesting
little duets and trios arise from one part or another
of the cabin.</p>

<p>"Hush, Johnny! be a good boy," says a pale, nursing
mamma, to a great, bristling, white-headed phenomenon,
who is kicking very much at large in her lap.</p>

<p>"I won't be a good boy, neither," responds Johnny,
with interesting explicitness; "I want to go to bed, and
so-o-o-o!" and Johnny makes up a mouth as big as a tea-cup,
and roars with good courage, and his mamma asks him
"if he ever saw pa do so," and tells him that "he is
mamma's dear, good little boy, and must not make a
noise," with various observations of the kind, which are so
strikingly efficacious in such cases. Meanwhile the domestic
concert in other quarters proceeds with vigor.
"Mamma, I'm tired!" bawls a child. "Where's the
baby's nightgown?" calls a nurse. "Do take Peter up in
your lap, and keep him still." "Pray get out some biscuits
to stop their mouths." Meanwhile sundry babies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
strike in <i>con spirito</i>, as the music-books have it, and execute
various flourishes; the disconsolate mothers sigh, and look
as if all was over with them; and the young ladies appear
extremely disgusted, and wonder "what business women
have to be travelling round with children."</p>

<p>To these troubles succeeds the turning-out scene, when
the whole caravan is ejected into the gentlemen's cabin,
that the beds may be made. The red curtains are put
down, and in solemn silence all the last mysterious preparations
begin. At length it is announced that all is ready.
Forthwith the whole company rush back, and find the walls
embellished by a series of little shelves, about a foot wide,
each furnished with a mattress and bedding, and hooked to
the ceiling by a very suspiciously slender cord. Direful
are the ruminations and exclamations of inexperienced
travellers, particularly young ones, as they eye these very
equivocal accommodations. "What, sleep up there! <i>I</i>
won't sleep on one of those top shelves, <i>I</i> know. The
cords will certainly break." The chambermaid here takes
up the conversation, and solemnly assures them that such
an accident is not to be thought of at all; that it is a natural
impossibility&mdash;a thing that could not happen without an
actual miracle; and since it becomes increasingly evident
that thirty ladies cannot all sleep on the lowest shelf, there
is some effort made to exercise faith in this doctrine; nevertheless
all look on their neighbors with fear and trembling;
and when the stout lady talks of taking a shelf, she is most
urgently pressed to change places with her alarmed neighbor
below. Points of location being after a while adjusted,
comes the last struggle. Everybody wants to take off a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>bonnet, or look for a shawl, to find a cloak, or get a carpet-bag,
and all set about it with such zeal that nothing can be
done. "Ma'am, you're on my foot!" says one. "Will
you please to move, ma'am?" says somebody, who is gasping
and struggling behind you. "Move!" you echo.
"Indeed, I should be very glad to, but I don't see much
prospect of it." "Chambermaid!" calls a lady who is
struggling among a heap of carpet-bags and children at one
end of the cabin. "Ma'am!" echoes the poor chambermaid,
who is wedged fast in a similar situation at the other.
"Where's my cloak, chambermaid?" "I'd find it,
ma'am, if I could move." "Chambermaid, my basket!"
"Chambermaid, my parasol!" "Chambermaid, my carpet-bag!"
"Mamma, they push me so!" "Hush, child;
crawl under there and lie still till I can undress you." At
last, however, the various distresses are over, the babies
sink to sleep, and even that much-enduring being, the
chambermaid, seeks out some corner for repose. Tired
and drowsy, you are just sinking into a doze, when bang!
goes the boat against the sides of a lock; ropes scrape, men
run and shout; and up fly the heads of all the top-shelfites,
who are generally the more juvenile and airy part of the
company.</p>

<p>"What's that! what's that!" flies from mouth to
mouth; and forthwith they proceed to awaken their respective
relations. "Mother! Aunt Hannah! do wake
up; what is this awful noise?" "Oh, only a lock."
"Pray, be still," groan out the sleepy members from below.</p>

<p>"A lock!" exclaim the vivacious creatures, ever on the
alert for information; "and what <i>is</i> a lock, pray?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know what a lock is, you silly creatures.
Do lie down and go to sleep."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span></p>
<p>"But say, there ain't any <i>danger</i> in a lock, is there?"
respond the querists. "Danger!" exclaims a deaf old
lady, poking up her head. "What's the matter? There
hain't nothing burst, has there?" "No, no, no!" exclaim
the provoked and despairing opposition party, who find that
there is no such thing as going to sleep till they have made
the old lady below and the young ladies above understand
exactly the philosophy of a lock. After a while the conversation
again subsides; again all is still; you hear only
the trampling of horses and the rippling of the rope in the
water, and sleep again is stealing over you. You doze, you
dream, and all of a sudden you are startled by a cry,
"Chambermaid! wake up the lady that wants to be set
ashore." Up jumps chambermaid, and up jump the lady
and two children, and forthwith form a committee of inquiry
as to ways and means. "Where's my bonnet?" says
the lady, half awake and fumbling among the various articles
of that name. "I thought I hung it up behind the door."
"Can't you find it?" says the poor chambermaid, yawning
and rubbing her eyes. "Oh, yes, here it is," says the
lady; and then the cloak, the shawl, the gloves, the shoes,
receive each a separate discussion. At last all seems ready,
and they begin to move off, when lo! Peter's cap is missing.
"Now, where can it be?" soliloquizes the lady. "I
put it right here by the table-leg; maybe it got into some
of the berths." At this suggestion the chambermaid takes
the candle, and goes round deliberately to every berth,
poking the light directly in the face of every sleeper.
"Here it is," she exclaims, pulling at something black
under one pillow. "No, indeed, those are my shoes,"
says the vexed sleeper. "Maybe it's here," she resumes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>darting upon something dark in another berth. "No,
that's my bag," responds the occupant. The chambermaid
then proceeds to turn over all the children on the floor, to
see if it is not under them. In the course of which process
they are most agreeably waked up and enlivened; and
when everybody is broad awake, and most uncharitably
wishing the cap, and Peter too, at the bottom of the canal,
the good lady exclaims, "Well, if this isn't lucky; here I
had it safe in my basket all the time!" And she departed
amid the&mdash;what shall I say? execrations!&mdash;of the whole
company, ladies though they be.</p>

<p>Well, after this follows a hushing up and wiping up
among the juvenile population, and a series of remarks
commences from the various shelves of a very edifying and
instructive tendency. One says that the woman did not
seem to know where anything was; another says that she has
waked them all up; a third adds that she has waked up all
the children, too; and the elderly ladies make moral reflections
on the importance of putting your things where you
can find them&mdash;being always ready; which observations,
being delivered in an exceedingly doleful and drowsy tone,
form a sort of sub-bass to the lively chattering of the upper-shelfites,
who declare that they feel quite awake&mdash;that they
don't think they shall go to sleep again to-night, and discourse
over everything in creation, until you heartily wish
you were enough related to them to give them a scolding.</p>

<p>At last, however, voice after voice drops off; you fall
into a most refreshing slumber; it seems to you that you
sleep about a quarter of an hour, when the chambermaid
pulls you by the sleeve. "Will you please to get up,
ma'am? We want to make the beds." You start and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>stare. Sure enough, the night is gone. So much for
sleeping on board canal-boats!</p>

<p>Let us not enumerate the manifold perplexities of the
morning toilet in a place where every lady realizes most
forcibly the condition of the old woman who lived under a
broom: "All she wanted was elbow-room." Let us not
tell how one glass is made to answer for thirty fair faces,
one ewer and vase for thirty lavations; and&mdash;tell it not in
Gath&mdash;one towel for a company! Let us not intimate how
ladies' shoes have, in a night, clandestinely slid into the
gentlemen's cabin, and gentlemen's boots elbowed, or,
rather, <i>toed</i> their way among ladies' gear, nor recite the exclamations
after runaway property that are heard.</p>

<p>"I can't find nothing of Johnny's shoe!" "Here's a
shoe in the water-pitcher&mdash;is this it?" "My side-combs
are gone!" exclaims a nymph with dishevelled curls.
"Massy! do look at my bonnet!" exclaims an old lady,
elevating an article crushed into as many angles as there are
pieces in a mince-pie. "I never did sleep <i>so much together</i>
in my life," echoes a poor little French lady, whom
despair has driven into talking English.</p>

<p>But our shortening paper warns us not to prolong our
catalogue of distresses beyond reasonable bounds, and therefore
we will close with advising all our friends, who intend
to try this way of travelling for <i>pleasure</i>, to take a good
stock both of patience and clean towels with them, for we
think that they will find abundant need for both.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="center">"SAMPLES" HERE AND THERE.</p>

<p>Next comes Mrs. Caroline M. Kirkland with her Western
sketches. Many will remember her laughable description of
"Borrowing Out West," with its two appropriate mottoes:
"Lend me your ears," from Shakespeare, and from Bacon:
"Grant graciously what you cannot refuse safely."</p>

<p>"'Mother wants your sifter,' said Miss Ianthe Howard,
a young lady of six years' standing, attired in a tattered
calico thickened with dirt; her unkempt locks straggling
from under that hideous substitute for a bonnet so universal
in the Western country&mdash;a dirty cotton handkerchief&mdash;which
is used <i>ad nauseam</i> for all sorts of purposes.</p>

<p>"'Mother wants your sifter, and she says she guesses
you can let her have some sugar and tea, 'cause you've got
plenty.' This excellent reason, ''cause you've got plenty,'
is conclusive as to sharing with neighbors.</p>

<p>"Sieves, smoothing-irons, and churns run about as if
they had legs; one brass kettle is enough for a whole
neighborhood, and I could point to a cradle which has
rocked half the babies in Montacute.</p>

<p>"For my own part, I have lent my broom, my thread,
my tape, my spoons, my cat, my thimble, my scissors, my
shawl, my shoes, and have been asked for my combs and
brushes, and my husband for his shaving apparatus and
pantaloons."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span></p>
<p>Mrs. Whither, whose "Widow Bedott" is a familiar
name, resembles Mrs. Kirkland in her comic portraitures,
which were especially good of their kind, and never betrayed
any malice. The "Bedott Papers" first appeared
in 1846, and became popular at once. They are good
examples of what they simply profess to be: an amusing
series of comicalities.</p>

<p>I shall not quote from them, as every one who enjoys
that style of humor knows them by heart. It would be as
useless as copying "Now I lay me down to sleep," or
"Mary had a little lamb," for a child's collection of
verses!</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>There are many authors whom I cannot represent worthily
in these brief limits. When, encouraged by the unprecedented
popularity of this venture, I prepare an
encyclop&aelig;dia of the "Wit and Humor of American
Women," I can do justice to such writers as "Gail Hamilton"
and Miss Alcott, whose "Transcendental Wild Oats"
cannot be cut. Rose Terry Cooke thinks her "Knoware"
the only funny thing she has ever done. She is greatly
mistaken, as I can soon prove. "Knoware" ought to be
printed by itself to delight thousands, as her "Deacon's
Week" has already done. To search for a few good things
in the works of my witty friends is searching not for the
time-honored needle in a hay-mow, but for two or three
needles of just the right size out of a whole paper of
needles.</p>

<p>"The Insanity of Cain," by Mrs. Mary Mapes Dodge,
an inimitable satire on the feebleness of our jury system
and the absurd pretence of "temporary insanity," must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>wait for that encyclop&aelig;dia. And her "Miss Molony on
the Chinese Question" is known and admired by every one,
including the Prince of Wales, who was fairly convulsed by
its fun, when brought out by our favorite elocutionist, Miss
Sarah Cowell, who had the honor of reading before royalty.</p>

<p>I regretfully omit the "Peterkin Letters," by Lucretia P.
Hale, and time famous "William Henry Letters," by Mrs.
Abby Morton Diaz. The very best bit from Miss Sallie
McLean would be how "Grandma Spicer gets Grandpa
Ready for Sunday-school," from the "Cape Cod Folks;"
but why not save space for what is not in everybody's
mouth and memory? This is equally true of Mrs. Cleaveland's
"No Sects in Heaven," which, like Arabella Wilson's
"Sextant," goes the rounds of all the papers every
other year as a fresh delight.</p>

<p>Marietta Holley, too, must be allowed only a brief quotation.
"Samantha" is a family friend from Mexico to
Alaska. Mrs. Metta Victoria Victor, who died recently, has
written an immense amount of humorous sketches. Her
"Miss Slimmens," the boarding-house keeper, is a marked
character, and will be remembered by many.</p>

<p>I will select a few "samples," unsatisfactory because there
is so much more just as good, and then give room for others
less familiar.</p>

<h3><a name="MISS_LUCINDAS_PIG" id="MISS_LUCINDAS_PIG"></a>MISS LUCINDA'S PIG.</h3>

<p class="center">BY ROSE TERRY COOKE.</p>

<p>"You don't know of any poor person who'd like to
have a pig, do you?" said Miss Lucinda, wistfully.</p>

<p>"Well, the poorer they was, the quicker they'd eat him
up, I guess&mdash;ef they could eat such a razor-back."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, I don't like to think of his being eaten! I wish
he could be got rid of some other way. Don't you think
he might be killed in his sleep, Israel?"</p>

<p>"I think it's likely it would wake him up," said he,
demurely. "Killin' 's killin', and a critter can't sleep
over it 's though 'twas the stomachache. I guess he'd kick
some, ef he <i>was</i> asleep&mdash;and screech some, too!"</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Miss Lucinda, horrified at the idea.
"I wish he could be sent out to run in the woods. Are
there any good woods near here, Israel?"</p>

<p>"I don't know but what he'd as lieves be slartered to
once as to starve an' be hunted down out in the lots. Besides,
there ain't nobody as I knows of would like a hog to
be a-rootin' round among their turnips and young wheat."</p>

<p>"Well, what I shall do with him I don't know!" despairingly
exclaimed Miss Lucinda. "He was such a dear
little thing when you bought him, Israel! Do you remember
how pink his pretty little nose was&mdash;just like a rosebud&mdash;and
how bright his eyes were, and his cunning legs?
And now he's grown so big and fierce! But I can't help
liking him, either."</p>

<p>"He's a cute critter, that's sartain; but he does too much
rootin' to have a pink nose now, I expect; there's consider'ble
on 't, so I guess it looks as well to have it gray. But
I don't know no more'n you do what to do abaout it."</p>

<p>"If I could only get rid of him without knowing what
became of him!" exclaimed Miss Lucinda, squeezing her
forefinger with great earnestness, and looking both puzzled
and pained.</p>

<p>"If Mees Lucinda would pairmit?" said a voice behind
her.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span></p>
<p>She turned round to see Monsieur Leclerc on his crutches,
just in the parlor-door.</p>

<p>"I shall, mees, myself dispose of piggie, if it please. I
can. I shall have no sound; he shall to go away like a
silent snow, to trouble you no more, never!"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, if you could! But I don't see how!"</p>

<p>"If mees was to see, it would not be to save her pain.
I shall have him to go by <i>magique</i> to fiery land."</p>

<p>Fairy-land, probably. But Miss Lucinda did not perceive
the <i>&eacute;quivoque</i>.</p>

<p>"Nor yet shall I trouble Meester Israyel. I shall have
the aid of myself and one good friend that I have; and
some night, when you rise of the morning, he shall not be
there."</p>

<p>Miss Lucinda breathed a deep sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"I am greatly obliged&mdash;I mean, I shall be," said she.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad enough to wash my hands on 't," said
Israel. "I shall hanker arter the critter some, but he's
a-gettin' too big to be handy; 'n it's one comfort about
critters, you ken git rid on 'em somehaow when they're
more plague than profit. But folks has got to be let alone,
excep' the Lord takes 'em; an' He generally don't see fit."&mdash;<i>From
Somebody's Neighbors.</i></p>

<h3><a name="A_GIFT_HORSE" id="A_GIFT_HORSE"></a>A GIFT HORSE.</h3>

<p class="center">BY ROSE TERRY COOKE.</p>

<p>"Well, he no need to ha' done it, Sary. I've told him
more'n four times he hadn't ought to pull a gun tow'rds him
by the muzzle on't. Now he's up an' did it once for all."</p>

<p>"He won't never have no chance to do it again, Scotty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>if you don't hurry up after the doctor," said Sary, wiping
her eyes on her dirty calico apron, thereby adding an
effective shadow under their redness.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm a-goin', ain't I? But ye know yerself
'twon't do to go so fur on eend, 'thout ye're vittled consider'ble
well."</p>

<p>So saying, he fell to at the meal she had interrupted, hot
potatoes, cold pork, dried venison, and blueberry pie vanishing
down his throat with an alacrity and dispatch that
augured well for the thorough "vittling" he intended,
while Sary went about folding chunks of boiled ham, thick
slices of brown bread, solid rounds of "sody biskit," and
slab-sided turnovers in a newspaper, filling a flat bottle
with whiskey, and now and then casting a look at the low
bed where young Harry McAlister lay, very much whiter
than the sheets about him, and quite as unconscious of surroundings,
the blood oozing slowly through such bandages
as Scott Peck's rude surgery had twisted about a gunshot-wound
in his thigh, and brought to close tension by a stick
thrust through the folds, turned as tight as could be borne,
and strapped into place by a bit of coarse twine.</p>

<p>It was a long journey paddling up the Racquette River,
across creek and carry, with the boat on his back, to the
lakes, and then from Martin's to "Harri'tstown," where
he knew a surgeon of repute from a great city was spending
his vacation. It was touch-and-go with Harry before Scott
and Dr. Drake got back. Sary had dosed him with venison-broth,
hot and greasy, weak whiskey and water, and a
little milk (only a little), for their cow was old and pastured
chiefly on leaves and twigs, and she only came back to the
shanty when she liked or needed to come, so their milk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
supply was uncertain, and Sary dared not leave her patient
long enough to row to the end of Tupper's Lake, where
the nearest cow was kept. But youth has a power of
recovery that defies circumstance, and Dr. Drake was very
skilful. Long weeks went by, and the green woods of July
had brightened and faded into October's dim splendor before
Harry McAlister could be carried up the river and
over to Bartlett's, where his mother had been called to
meet him. She was a widow, and he her only child; and,
though she was rather silly and altogether unpractical, she
had a tender, generous heart, and was ready to do anything
possible for Scott and Sarah Peck to show her gratitude for
their kindness to her boy. She did not consult Harry at
all. He had lost much blood from his accident and recovered
strength slowly. She kept everything like thought or
trouble out of his way as far as she could, and when the
family physician found her heart was set on taking him to
Florida for the winter, because he looked pale and her
grandmother's aunt had died of consumption, Dr. Peet,
like a wise man, rubbed his hands together, bowed, and
assured her it would be the very thing. But something
must be done for the Pecks before she went away. It
occurred to her how difficult it must be for them to row
everywhere in a small boat. A horse would be much better.
Even if the roads were not good they could ride,
Sarah behind Scott. And so useful in farming, too. Her
mind was made up at once. She dispatched a check for
three hundred dollars to Peter Haas, her old coachman,
who had bought a farm in Vermont with his savings, and
retired, with the cook for his wife, into the private life of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>farmer. Mrs. McAlister had much faith in Peter's knowledge<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">of horses and his honesty. She wrote him to buy a</span><br />
strong, steady animal, and convey it to Scott Peck, either
sending him word to come up to Bartlett's after it, or taking
it down the river; but, at any rate, to make sure he
had it. If the check would not pay all expenses, he was to
draw on her for more. Peter took the opportunity to get
rid of a horse he had no use for in winter; a beast restive
as a racer when not in daily use, but strong enough for any
work, and steady enough if he had work. Two hundred
and fifty dollars was the price now set on his head, though
Peter had bought him for seventy-five, and thought him
dear at that. The remaining fifty was ample for expenses;
but Peter was a prudent German and liked a margin.
There was no difficulty in getting the horse as far as
Martin's, and by dint of patient insistence Peter contrived
to have him conveyed to Bartlett's; but here he rested and
sent a messenger down to Scott Peck, while he himself
returned to Bridget at the farm, slowly cursing the country
and the people as he went his way, for his delays and
troubles had been numerous.</p>

<p>"Gosh!" said Scott Peck, when he stepped up to the
log-house that served for the guides, unknowing what
awaited him, for the messenger had not found him at home,
but left word he was to come to Bartlett's for something,
and the first thing he saw was this gray horse.</p>

<p>"What fool fetched his hoss up here?"</p>

<p>The guides gathered about the door of their hut, burst
into a loud cackle of laughter; even the beautiful hounds
in their rough kennel leaped up and bayed.</p>

<p>"W-a-a-l;" drawled lazy Joe Tucker, "the feller 't
owns him ain't nobody's fool. Be ye, Scotty?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span></p>
<p>"Wha-t!" ejaculated Scott.</p>

<p>"It's your'n, man, sure as shootin'!" laughed Hearty
Jack, Joe Tucker's brother.</p>

<p>"Mine? Jehoshaphat! Blaze that air track, will ye?
I'm lost, sure."</p>

<p>"Well, Bartlett's gone out Keeseville way, so't kinder
was lef' to me to tell ye. 'Member that ar chap that shot
hisself in the leg down to your shanty this summer?"</p>

<p>"Well, I expect I do, seein' I ain't more'n a hundred
year old," sarcastically answered Scott.</p>

<p>"He's cleared out South-aways some'eres, and his ma
consaited she was dredful obleeged to ye; 'n I'm blessed if
she didn't send an old Dutch feller up here fur to fetch ye
that hoss fur a present. He couldn't noways wait to see ye
pus'nally, he sed, fur he mistrusted the' was snows here
sometimes 'bout this season. Ho! ho! ho!"</p>

<p>"Good land!" said Scott, sitting down on a log, and
putting his hands in his pockets, the image of perplexity,
while the men about him roared with fresh laughter.
"What be I a-goin' to do with the critter?" he asked of
the crowd.</p>

<p>"Blessed if I know," answered Hearty Jack.</p>

<p>"Can't ye get him out to 'Sable Falls or Keeseville 'n
sell him fur what he'll fetch?" suggested Joe Tucker.</p>

<p>"I can't go now, noways. Sary's wood-pile's nigh gin
out, 'n there was a mighty big sundog yesterday; 'nd
moreover I smell snow. It'll be suthin' to git hum as 'tis.
Mabbe Bartlett'll keep him a spell."</p>

<p>"No, he won't; you kin bet your head. His fodder's
a-runnin' short for the hornid critters. He's bought some
up to Martin's, that's a-comin' down dyrect; but 'tain't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
enough. He's put to't for more. Shouldn't wonder ef he
had to draw from North Elby when sleddin' sets in."</p>

<p>"Well, I dono's there's but one thing for to do; fetch
him hum somehow or 'nother; 'nd there's my boat over to
the carry!"</p>

<p>"You'd better tie the critter on behind an' let him wade
down the Racket!"</p>

<p>Another shout of laughter greeted this proposal.</p>

<p>"I s'all take ze boat for you!" quietly said a little
brown Canadian&mdash;Jean Poiton. "I am go to Tupper to-morrow.
I have one hunt to make. I can take her."</p>

<p>"Well said, Gene. I'll owe you a turn. But, fur all,
how be I goin' to get that animile 'long the trail?"</p>

<p>"I dono!" answered Joe Tucker. "I expect, if it's
got to be did, you'll fetch it somehow. But I'm mighty
glad 'tain't my job!"</p>

<p>Scott Peck thought Joe had good reason for joy in that
direction before he had gone a mile on his homeward way!
The trail was only a trail, rough, devious, crossed with
roots of trees, brushed with boughs of fir and pine, and the
horse was restive and unruly. By nightfall he had gone
only a few miles, and when he had tied the beast to a tree
and covered him with a blanket brought from Bartlett's for
the purpose, and strapped on his own back all the way, the
light of the camp-fire startled the horse so that Scott was
forced to blind him with a comforter before he would stand
still. Then in the middle of the night, a great owl hooting
from the tree-top just above him was a fresh scare, and but
that the strap and rope both were new and strong he would
have escaped. Scott listened to his rearing, trampling,
snorts, and wild neigh with the composure of a sleepy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>
man; but when he awoke at daylight, and found four
inches of snow had fallen during the night, he swore.</p>

<p>This was too much. Even to his practised woodcraft it
seemed impossible to get the horse safe to his clearing without
harm. It was only by dint of the utmost care and
patience, the greatest watchfulness of the way, that he got
along at all. Every rod or two he stumbled, and all but
fell himself. Here and there a loaded hemlock bough,
weighed out of its uprightness by the wet snow, snapped in
his face and blinded him with its damp burden; and he
knew long before nightfall that another night in the woods
was inevitable. He could feed the horse on young twigs of
beech and birch; fresh moss, and new-peeled bark (fodder
the animal would have resented with scorn under any other
conditions); but hunger has no law concerning food. Scott
himself was famished; but his pipe and tobacco were a refuge
whose value he knew before, and his charge was tired
enough to be quiet this second night; so the man had an
undisturbed sleep by his comfortable fire. It was full noon
of the next day when he reached his cabin. Jean Poiton
had tied his boat to its stake, and gone on without stopping
to speak to Sarah; so her surprise was wonderful when she
saw Scott emerge from the forest, leading a gray creature,
with drooping head and shambling gait, tired and dispirited.</p>

<p>"Heaven's to Betsey, Scott Peck! What hev you got
theer?"</p>

<p>"The devil!" growled Scott.</p>

<p>Sary screamed.</p>

<p>"Do hold your jaw, gal, an' git me su'thin' hot to eat 'n
drink. I'm savager'n an Injin. Come, git along." And,
tying his horse to a stump, the hungry man followed Sarah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
into the house and helped himself out of a keg in the corner
to a long, reviving draught.</p>

<p>"Du tell!" said Sarah, when the pork began to frizzle
in the pan. "What upon airth did you buy a hoss for?"
(She had discovered it was a horse.)</p>

<p>"Buy it! I guess not. I ain't no such blamed fool as
that comes to. That feller you nussed up here a spell back,
he up an' sent it roun' to Bartlett's, for a present to me."</p>

<p>"Well! Did he think you was a-goin' to set up canawl
long o' Racket?"</p>

<p>"I expect he calc'lated I'd go racin'," dryly answered
Scott.</p>

<p>"But what be ye a-goin' to feed him with?" said Sary,
laying venison steaks into the pan.</p>

<p>"Lord knows! I don't. Shut up, Sary! I'm tuckered
out with the beast. I'd ruther still-hunt three weeks
on eend than fetch him in from Sar'nac, now I tell ye.
Ain't them did enough? I could eat a raw bear."</p>

<p>Sary laughed and asked no more questions till the ravenous
man had satisfied himself with the savory food; but, if
she had asked them, Scott would have had no answer, for
his mind was perplexed to the last degree. He fed the
beast for a while on potatoes; but that was taking the bread
out of his own mouth, though he supplemented it with now
and then a boat-load of coarse, frost-killed grass, but the
horse grew more and more gaunt and restive. His eyes
glared with hunger and fury. He kicked out one side of
the cowshed and snapped at Scott whenever he came near
him. Want of use and food had restored him to the original
savagery of his race. Hitherto Scott had never acknowledged
Mrs McAlister's gift; but Sary, who had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>
vague idea of good manners, caught from the picture papers
and occasional dime novels the tribe of Adirondack travellers
strew even in such a wilderness, kept pecking at him.</p>

<p>"Ta'n't no more'n civil to say thank ye, to the least,"
she said, till Scott's temper gave way.</p>

<p>"Stop a-pesterin' of me! I've hed too much. I ain't
a speck thankful! I'm mightily t'other thing, whatever
'tis. Write to her yourself, if you're a mind tu. You can
make a better fist at it, anyways. Comes as nateral to
women to lie as sap to run. I'll be etarnally blessed ef I
touch paper for to do it." And he flung out of the door
with a bang.</p>

<p>Of course Sary wrote the letter, which one balmy day
electrified Harry and his mother as they sat basking in
Southern sunshine:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Mis Macallistur</span>: This is fur to say wee is reel obliged to ye fur the
<span class="smcap">Hoss</span>."</p></div>

<p>"Good gracious, mother! Did you send them a horse?"
ejaculated Harry.</p>

<p>"Why, my dear, I wanted to show my sense of their
kindness, and I could not offer these people money. I
thought a horse would be so useful!"</p>

<p>"Useful! in the Adirondack woods!" And Harry
burst into a fit of laughter that scarcely permitted his
mother to go on; but at last she proceeded:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"But Scotty and me ain't ackwainted So to speak with Hoss ways;
he seems kinder Hum-sick if you may say that of a Cretur. We air
etarnally gratified to You for sech a Valewble Pressent, but if you was
Wiling we shood Like to swapp it of in spring fur a kow, ourn Being

</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span></p>
<p>But long before Mrs. McAlister's permission to "swap"
the horse reached Scott Peck, the creature took his destiny
into his own hands. Scott had gone away on a desperate
errand, to fetch some sort of food for the poor creature,
whose bones stared him in the face, and Sary went out one
morning to give him her potato-peelings and some scraps of
bread, when, suddenly, he jerked his head fiercely, snapped
his halter in two, and wheeled round upon the frightened
woman, rearing, snorting, and showing his long, yellow
teeth. Sary fled at once and barred the door behind her;
but neither she nor Scott ever saw their "gift horse" again.
For aught I know he still roams the Adirondack forest, and
maybe personates the ghostly and ghastly white deer of
song and legend. Who can tell? But he was lifted off
Scott Peck's shoulders, and all Scott said by way of epitaph
on the departed, when he came home to find his white steed
gone, was, "Hang presents!"</p>

<p>"Samantha Allen" will now have "a brief opportunity
for remark."</p>

<p>Admire her graphic description of the excitement Josiah
caused by voting, at a meeting of the "Jonesville Creation
Searchers," for his own spouse as a delegate from
Jonesville to the "Sentinel." She reports thus:</p>

<p>"It was a fearful time, but right where the excitement
was raining most fearfully I felt a motion by the side of me,
and my companion got up and stood on his feet and says,
in <i>pretty</i> firm accents, though <i>some</i> sheepish:</p>

<p>"'<i>I</i> did, and there's where I stand now; <i>I</i> vote for
<i>Samantha</i>!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span></p><p>"And then he sot down again. Oh, the fearful excitement
and confusion that rained down again! The president
got up and tried to speak; the editor of the <i>Auger</i> talked
wildly; Shakespeare Bobbet talked to himself incoherently,
but Solomon Cypher's voice drowned 'em all out, as he
kep' a-smitin' his breast and a hollerin' that he wasn't goin'
to be infringed upon, or come in contract with <i>no</i> woman!</p>

<p>"No female woman needn't think she was the equal of
man; and I should go as a woman or stay to home. I was
so almost wore out by their talk, that I spoke right out, and,
says I, '<i>Good land!</i> how did you <i>s'pose</i> I was a-goin'?'</p>

<p>"The president then said that he meant, if I went I
mustn't look upon things with the eye of a 'Creation
Searcher' and a man (here he p'inted his forefinger right up
in the air and waved it round in a real free and soarin' way),
but look at things with the eye of a private investigator and
a <i>woman</i> (here he p'inted his finger firm and stiddy right
down into the wood-box and a pan of ashes). It war impressive&mdash;<span class="smcap">VERY</span>."</p>

<p>"Dora! Dora! Dora! wake up, wake up, I say! Don't
you smell something burning? Wake up, child! Don't
you smell fire? Good Lord! so do I. I thought I wasn't
mistaken. The room's full of smoke. Oh, dear! what'll
we do? Don't stop to put on your petticoat. We'll all be
burned to death. Fire! fire! fire! fire!</p>

<p>"Yes, there is! I don't know where! It's all over&mdash;our
room's all in a blaze, and Dora won't come out till she gets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
her dress on. Mr. Little, you <i>shan't</i> go in&mdash;I'll hold you&mdash;you'll
be killed just to save that chit of a girl, when&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;He's
gone&mdash;rushed right into the flames. Oh, my
house! my furniture! all my earnings! Can't anything
be done? Fire! fire! fire! Call the fire-engines! ring
the dinner-bell! Be quiet! How can I be quiet? Yes,
it is all in flames. I saw them myself! Where's my silver
spoons? Oh, where's my teeth, and my silver soup-ladle?
Let me be! I'm going out in the street before it's too
late! Oh, Mr. Grayson! have you got water? have you
found the place? are they bringing water?</p>

<p>"Did you say the fire was out? Was that you that spoke,
Mr. Little? I thought you were burned up, sure; and
there's Dora, too. How did they get it out? My clothes-closet
was on fire, and the room, too! We would have
been smothered in five minutes more if we hadn't waked
up! But it's all out now, and no damage done, but my
dresses destroyed and the carpet spoiled. Thank the Lord,
if that's the worst! But it <i>ain't</i> the worst. Dora, come
along this minute to my room. I don't care if it is cold,
and wet, and full of smoke. Don't you see&mdash;don't you see
I'm in my night-clothes? I never thought of it before.
I'm ruined, ruined completely! Go to bed, gentlemen;
get out of the way as quick as you can Dora, shut the
door. Hand me that candle; I want to look at myself in
the glass. To think that all those gentlemen should have
seen me in this fix! I'd rather have perished in the flames.
It's the very first night I've worn these flannel night-caps,
and to be seen in 'em! Good gracious! how old I do
look! Not a spear of hair on my head scarcely, and this
red nightgown and old petticoat on, and my teeth in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
tumbler, and the paint all washed off my face, and scarred
besides! It's no use! I never, never can again make any
of <i>those</i> men believe that I'm only twenty-five, and I felt so
sure of some of them.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dora Adams! <i>you</i> needn't look pale; you've lost
nothing. I'll warrant Mr. Little thought you never looked
so pretty as in that ruffled gown, and your hair all down
over your shoulders. He says you were fainting from the
smoke when he dragged you out. You must be a little fool
to be afraid to come out looking <i>that</i> way. They say that
new boarder is a drawing-master, and I seen some of his
pictures yesterday; he had some such ridiculous things.
He'll caricature me for the amusement of the young men,
I know. Only think how my portrait would look taken to-night!
and he'll have it, I'm sure, for I noticed him looking
at me&mdash;the first that reminded me of my situation after
the fire was put out. Well, there's but one thing to be
done, and that's to put a bold face on it. I can't sleep any
more to-night; besides, the bed's wet, and it's beginning
to get daylight. I'll go to work and get myself ready for
breakfast, and I'll pretend to something&mdash;I don't know just
what&mdash;to get myself out of this scrape, if I can....</p>

<p>"Good-morning, gentlemen, good-morning! We had
quite a fright last night, didn't we? Dora and I came
pretty near paying dear for a little frolic. You see, we
were dressing up in character to amuse ourselves, and I was
all fixed up for to represent an old woman, and had put on
a gray wig and an old flannel gown that I found, and we'd
set up pretty late, having some fun all to ourselves; and I
expect Dora must have been pretty sleepy when she was
putting some of the things away, and set fire to a dress in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
the closet without noticing it. I've lost my whole wardrobe,
nigh about, by her carelessness; but it's such a mercy
we wasn't burned in our bed that I don't feel to complain
so much on that account. Isn't it curious how I got caught
dressed up like my grandmother? We didn't suppose we
were going to appear before so large an audience when we
planned out our little frolic. What character did Dora
assume? Really, Mr. Little, I was so scared last night
that I disremember. She took off <i>her</i> rigging before she
went to bed. Don't you think I'd personify a pretty good
old woman, gentlemen&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;for a lady of my age?
What's that, Mr. Little? You wish I'd make you a present
of that nightcap, to remember me by? Of course;
I've no further use for it. Of course I haven't. It's one
of Bridget's, that I borrowed for the occasion, and I've got
to give it back to her. Have some coffee, Mr. Grayson&mdash;do!
I've got cream for it this morning. Mr. Smith, help
yourself to some of the beefsteak. It's a very cold morning&mdash;fine
weather out of doors. Eat all you can, all of you.
Have you any profiles to take yet, Mr. Gamboge? I <i>may</i>
make up my mind to set for mine before you leave us;
I've always thought I should have it taken some time. In
character? He! he! Mr. Little, you're so funny! But
you'll excuse <i>me</i> this morning, as I had such a fright last
night. I must go and take up that wet carpet."</p>

<p class="center">A BRACE OF WITTY WOMEN.</p>

<p>By the courtesy of Harper Brothers I am allowed to give
you "Aunt Anniky's Teeth," by Sherwood Bonner. The
illustrations add much, but the story is good enough without
pictures.</p>

<h3><a name="AUNT_ANNIKYS_TEETH" id="AUNT_ANNIKYS_TEETH"></a>AUNT ANNIKY'S TEETH.</h3>

<p class="center">BY SHERWOOD BONNER.</p>

<p>Aunt Anniky was an African dame, fifty years old, and
of an imposing presence. As a waffle-maker she possessed
a gift beyond the common, but her unapproachable talent
lay in the province of nursing. She seemed born for the
benefit of sick people. She should have been painted with
the apple of healing in her hand. For the rest, she was a
funny, illiterate old darkey, vain, affable, and neat as a pink.</p>

<p>On one occasion my mother had a dangerous illness.
Aunt Anniky nursed her through it, giving herself no rest,
night nor day, until her patient had come "back to de
walks an' ways ob life," as she expressed the dear mother's
recovery. My father, overjoyed and grateful, felt that we
owed this result quite as much to Aunt Anniky as to our
family doctor, so he announced his intention of making her
a handsome present, and, like King Herod, left her free to
choose what it should be. I shall never forget how Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
Anniky looked as she stood there smiling and bowing, and
bobbing the funniest little courtesies all the way down to
the ground.</p>

<p>And you would never guess what it was the old woman
asked for.</p>

<p>"Well, Mars' Charles," said she (she had been one of
our old servants, and always called my father 'Mars'
Charles'), "to tell you de livin' trufe, my soul an' body is
a-yearnin' fur a han'sum chany set o' teef."</p>

<p>"A set of teeth!" said father, surprised enough. "And
have you none left of your own?"</p>

<p>"I has gummed it fur a good many ye'rs," said Aunt
Anniky, with a sigh; "but not wishin' ter be ongrateful
ter my obligations, I owns ter havin' five nateral teef. But
dey is po' sogers; dey shirks battle. One ob dem's got a
little somethin' in it as lively as a speared worm, an' I tell
you when anything teches it, hot or cold, it jest makes me
<i>dance</i>! An' anudder is in my top jaw, an' ain't got no
match fur it in de bottom one; an' one is broke off nearly
to de root; an' de las' two is so yaller dat I's ashamed ter
show 'em in company, an' so I lif's my turkey-tail ter my
mouf every time I laughs or speaks."</p>

<p>Father turned to mother with a musing air. "The curious
student of humanity," he remarked, "traces resemblances
where they are not obviously conspicuous. Now,
at the first blush, one would not think of any common
ground of meeting for our Aunt Anniky and the Empress
Josephine. Yet that fine French lady introduced the fashion
of handkerchiefs by continually raising delicate lace
<i>mouchoirs</i> to her lips to hide her bad teeth. Aunt Anniky
lifts her turkey-tail! It really seems that human beings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
should be classed by <i>strata</i>, as if they were metals in the
earth. Instead of dividing by nations, let us class by
quality. So we might find Turk, Jew, Christian, fashionable
lady and washerwoman, master and slave, hanging
together like cats on a clothes-line by some connecting cord
of affinity&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In the mean time," said my mother, mildly, "Aunt
Anniky is waiting to know if she is to have her teeth."</p>

<p>"Oh, surely, surely!" cried father, coming out of the
clouds with a start. "I am going to the village to-morrow,
Anniky, in the spring wagon. I will take you with me,
and we will see what the dentist can do for you."</p>

<p>"Bless yo' heart, Mars' Charles!" said the delighted
Anniky; "you're jest as good as yo' blood and yo' name,
and mo' I <i>couldn't</i> say."</p>

<p>The morrow came, and with it Aunt Anniky, gorgeously
arrayed in a flaming red calico, a bandanna handkerchief,
and a string of carved yellow beads that glittered on her
bosom like fresh buttercups on a hill-slope.</p>

<p>I had petitioned to go with the party, for, as we lived on
a plantation, a visit to the village was something of an
event. A brisk drive soon brought us to the centre of
"the Square." A glittering sign hung brazenly from a
high window on its western side, bearing, in raised black
letters, the name, "Doctor Alonzo Babb."</p>

<p>Dr. Babb was the dentist and the odd fish of our village.
He beams in my memory as a big, round man, with hair and
smiles all over his face, who talked incessantly, and said
things to make your blood run cold.</p>

<p>"Do you see this ring?" he said, as he bustled about,
polishing his instruments and making his preparations for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
the sacrifice of Aunt Anniky. He held up his right hand,
on the forefinger of which glistened a ring the size of a dog-collar.
"Now, what d'ye s'pose that's made of?"</p>

<p>"Brass," suggested father, who was funny when not
philosophical.</p>

<p>"<i>Brass!</i>" cried Dr. Babb, with a withering look; "it's
virgin gold, that ring is. And where d'ye s'pose I found
the gold?"</p>

<p>My father ran his hands into his pockets in a retrospective
sort of way.</p>

<p>"In the mouths of my patients, every grain of it," said
the dentist, with a perfectly diabolical smack of the lips.
"Old fillings&mdash;plugs, you know&mdash;that I saved, and had
made up into this shape. Good deal of sentiment about
such a ring as this."</p>

<p>"Sentiment of a mixed nature, I should say," murmured
my father, with a grimace.</p>

<p>"Mixed&mdash;rather! A speck here, a speck there. Sometimes
an eye, oftener a jaw, occasionally a front. More than
a hundred men, I s'pose, have helped in the cause."</p>

<p>"Law, doctor! you beats de birds, you does," cries
Aunt Anniky, whose head was as flat as the floor, where
her reverence should have been. "You know dey snatches
de wool from ebery bush to make deir nests."</p>

<p>"Lots of company for me, that ring is," said the doctor,
ignoring the pertinent or impertinent interruption. "Often
as I sit in the twilight, I twirl it around and around,
a-thinking of the wagon-loads of food it has masticated, the
blood that has flowed over it, the groans that it has cost!
Now, old lady, if you will sit just here."</p>

<p>He motioned Aunt Anniky to the chair, into which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
dropped in a limp sort of way, recovering herself immediately,
however, and sitting bolt upright in a rigid attitude
of defiance. Some moments of persuasion were necessary
before she could be induced to lean back and allow Dr.
Babb's fingers on her nose while she breathed the laughing-gas;
but, once settled, the expression faded from her countenance
almost as quickly as a magic-lantern picture vanishes.
I watched her nervously, my attention divided
between her vacant-looking face and a dreadful picture on
the wall. It represented Dr. Babb himself, minus the hair,
but with double the number of smiles, standing by a patient
from whose mouth he had apparently just extracted a huge
molar that he held triumphantly in his forceps. A gray-haired
old gentleman regarded the pair with benevolent
interest. The photograph was entitled, "His First Tooth."</p>

<p>"Attracted by that picture?" said Dr. Alonzo, affably,
his fingers on Aunt Anniky's pulse. "My par had that
struck off the first time I ever got a tooth out. That's par
with the gray hair and the benediction attitude. Tell you,
he was proud of me! I had such an awful tussle with that
tooth! Thought the old fellow's jaw was <i>bound</i> to break!
But I got it out, and after that my par took me with him
round the country&mdash;starring the provinces, you know&mdash;and
I practised on the natives."</p>

<p>By this time Aunt Anniky was well under the influence
of the gas, and in an incredibly short space of time her five
teeth were out. As she came to herself I am sorry to say
she was rather silly, and quite mortified me by winking at
Dr. Babb in the most confidential manner, and repeating,
over and over again: "Honey, yer ain't harf as smart as
yer thinks yer is!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span></p>
<p>After a few weeks of sore gums, Aunt Anniky appeared,
radiant with her new teeth. The effect was certainly
funny. In the first place, blackness itself was not so black
as Aunt Anniky. She looked as if she had been dipped in
ink and polished off with lamp-black. Her very eyes
showed but the faintest rim of white. But those teeth were
white enough to make up for everything. She had selected
them herself, and the little ridiculous milk-white things
were more fitted for the mouth of a Titania than for the
great cavern in which Aunt Anniky's tongue moved and
had its being. The gums above them were black, and
when she spread her wide mouth in a laugh, it always
reminded me of a piano-lid opening suddenly and showing
all the black and white ivories at a glance. Aunt Anniky
laughed a good deal, too, after getting her teeth in, and
declared she had never been so happy in her life. It was
observed, to her credit, that she put on no airs of pride,
but was as sociable as ever, and made nothing of taking out
her teeth and handing them around for inspection among
her curious and admiring visitors. On that principle of
human nature which glories in calling attention to the
weakest part, she delighted in tough meats, stale bread,
green fruits, and all other eatables that test the biting quality
of the teeth. But finally destruction came upon them
in a way that no one could have foreseen. Uncle Ned was
an old colored man who lived alone in a cabin not very far
from Aunt Anniky's, but very different from her in point
of cleanliness and order. In fact, Uncle Ned's wealth,
apart from a little corn crop, consisted in a lot of fine
young pigs, that ran in and out of the house at all times,
and were treated by their owner as tenderly as if they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
been his children. One fine day the old man fell sick of a
fever, and he sent in haste for Aunt Anniky to come and
nurse him. He agreed to give her a pig in case she
brought him through; should she fail to do so, she was to
receive no pay. Well, Uncle Ned got well, and the next
thing we heard was that he refused to pay the pig. My
father was usually called on to settle all the disputes in the
neighborhood; so one morning Anniky and Ned appeared
before him, both looking very indignant.</p>

<p>"I'd jes' like ter tell yer, Mars' Charles," began Uncle
Ned, "ob de trick dis miser'ble ole nigger played on me."</p>

<p>"Go on, Ned," said my father, with a resigned air.</p>

<p>"Well, it wuz de fift night o' de fever," said Uncle
Ned, "an' I wuz a-tossin' an' a-moanin', an' old Anniky
jes' lay back in her cheer an' snored as ef a dozen frogs
wuz in her throat. I wuz a-perishin' an' a-burnin' wid
thirst, an' I hollered to Anniky; but Lor'! I might as
well 'a hollered to a tombstone! It wuz ice I wanted; an'
I knowed dar wuz a glass somewhar on my table wid
cracked ice in it. Lor'! Lor'! how dry I wuz! I neber
longed fer whiskey in my born days ez I panted fur dat ice.
It wuz powerful dark, fur de grease wuz low in de lamp,
an' de wick spluttered wid a dyin' flame. But I felt
aroun', feeble like an' slow, till my fingers touched a glass.
I pulled it to me, an' I run my han' in an' grabbed de ice,
as I s'posed, an' flung it in my mouf, an' crunched, an'
crunched&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here there was an awful pause. Uncle Ned pointed his
thumb at Anniky, looked wildly at my father, and said, in
a hollow voice: "<i>It wuz Anniky's teef!</i>"</p>

<p>My father threw back his head and laughed as I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
never heard him laugh. Mother from her sofa joined in.
I was doubled up like a jack-knife in the corner. But as
for the principals in the affair, neither of their faces moved
a muscle. They saw no joke. Aunt Anniky, in a dreadful,
muffled, squashy sort of voice, took up the tale:</p>

<p>"Nexsh ting I knowed, Marsh Sharles, somebody's
sheizin' me by de head, a-jammin' it up 'gin de wall,
a-jawin' at me like de Angel Gabriel at de rish ole sinners
in de bad plashe&mdash;an' dar wash ole Ned a-spittin' like a
black cat, an' a-howlin' so dreadful dat I tought he wash de
debil; an' when I got de light, dar wash my beautiful
chany teef a-flung aroun', like scattered seed-corn, on de
flo', an' Ned a-swarin' he'd have de law o' me."</p>

<p>"An' arter all dat," broke in Uncle Ned, "she pretends
to lay a claim fur my pig. But I says no, sir; I don't pay
nobody nothin' who's played me a trick like dat."</p>

<p>"Trick!" said Aunt Anniky, scornfully, "whar's de
trick? Tink I wanted yer ter eat my teef? An' furder-mo',
Marsh Sharles, dar's jes' dis about it: when dat night
set in dar warn't no mo' hope fur old Ned dan fur a foundered
sheep. Laws-a-massy! dat's why I went ter sleep.
I wanted ter hev strengt' ter put on his burial clo'es in de
mornin'. But don' yer see, Marsh Sharles, dat when he
got so mad it brought on a sweat dat <i>broke de fever</i>!
It saved him! But, fur all dat, arter munchin' an' manglin'
my chany teef, he has de imperdence ob tryin' to
'prive me ob de pig I honestly 'arned."</p>

<p>It was a hard case. Uncle Ned sat there a very image of
injured dignity, while Aunt Anniky bound a red handkerchief
around her mouth and fanned herself with her turkey-tail.</p>

<p>"I am sure I don't know how to settle the matter," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
father, helplessly. "Ned, I don't see but that you'll have
to pay up."</p>

<p>"Neber, Mars' Charles, neber."</p>

<p>"Well, suppose you get married?" suggested father,
brilliantly. "That will unite your interests, you know."</p>

<p>Aunt Anniky tossed her head. Uncle Ned was old,
wizened, wrinkled as a raisin, but he eyed Anniky over
with a supercilious gaze, and said with dignity: "Ef I
wanted ter marry, I could git a likely young gal."</p>

<p>All the four points of Anniky's turban shook with indignation.
"Pay me fur dem chany teef!" she hissed.</p>

<p>Some visitors interrupted the dispute at this time, and
the two old darkies went away.</p>

<p>A week later Uncle Ned appeared with rather a sheepish
look.</p>

<p>"Well, Mars' Charles," he said, "I's about concluded
dat I'll marry Anniky."</p>

<p>"Ah! is that so?"</p>

<p>"'Pears like it's de onliest way I kin save my pigs,"
said Uncle Ned, with a sigh. "When she's married she
boun' ter <i>'bey</i> me. Women 'bey your husbands; dat's
what de good Book says."</p>

<p>"Yes, she will <i>bay</i> you, I don't doubt," said my father,
making a pun that Uncle Ned could not appreciate.</p>

<p>"An' ef ever she opens her jaw ter me 'bout dem ar
teef," he went on, "I'll <i>mash</i> her."</p>

<p>Uncle Ned tottered on his legs like an unscrewed fruit-stand,
and I had my own opinion as to his "mashing"
Aunt Anniky. This opinion was confirmed the next day
when father offered her his congratulations. "You are
old enough to know your own mind," he remarked.</p>

<p>"I's ole, maybe," said Anniky, "but so is a oak-tree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
an' it's vigorous, I reckon. I's a purty vigorous sort o'
growth myself, an' I reckon I'll have my own way with
Ned. I'm gwine ter fatten dem pigs o' hisn, an' you see
ef I don't sell 'em nex' Christmas fur money 'nouf ter git a
new string o' chany teef."</p>

<p>"Look here, Anniky," said father, with a burst of
generosity, "you and Ned will quarrel about those teeth
till the day of doom, so I will make you a wedding present
of another set, that you may begin married life in
harmony."</p>

<p>Aunt Anniky expressed her gratitude. "An' <i>dis</i> time,"
she said, with sudden fury, "I sleeps wid 'em <i>in</i>."</p>

<p>The teeth were presented, and the wedding preparations
began. The expectant bride went over to Ned's cabin and
gave it such a clearing up as it had never had. But Ned
did not seem happy. He devoted himself entirely to his
pigs, and wandered about looking more wizened every day.
Finally he came to our gate and beckoned to me mysteriously.</p>

<p>"Come over to my house, honey," he whispered, "an'
bring a pen an' ink an' a piece o' paper wid yer. I wants
yer ter write me a letter."</p>

<p>I ran into the house for my little writing-desk, and followed
Uncle Ned to his cabin.</p>

<p>"Now, honey," he said, after barring the door carefully,
"don't you ax me no questions, but jes' put down de
words dat comes out o' my mouf on dat ar paper."</p>

<p>"Very well, Uncle Ned, go on."</p>

<p>"Anniky Hobbleston," he began, "dat weddin' ain't
a-gwine ter come off. You cleans up too much ter suit me.
I ain't used ter so much water splashin' aroun'. Dirt is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>
warmin'. 'Spec I'd freeze dis winter if you wuz here.
An' you got too much tongue. Besides, I's got anudder
wife over in Tipper. An' I ain't a-gwine ter marry. As
fur havin' de law, I's a leavin' dese parts, an' I takes der
pigs wid me. Yer can't fin' <i>dem</i>, an' yer can't fin' <i>me</i>.
<i>Fur I ain't a-gwine ter marry.</i> I wuz born a bachelor,
an' a bachelor will I represent myself befo' de judgment-seat.
If you gives yer promise ter say no mo' 'bout dis
marryin' business, p'r'aps I'll come back some day. So no
mo' at present, from your humble worshipper,</p>

<p class="p3">"Ned Cuddy."</p>

<p>"Isn't that last part rather inconsistent?" said I, greatly
amused.</p>

<p>"Yes, honey, if yer says so; an' it's kind o' soothin' to
de feelin's of a woman, yer know."</p>

<p>I wrote it all down and read it aloud to Uncle Ned.</p>

<p>"Now, my chile," he said, "I'm a-gwine ter git on my
mule as soon as der moon rises, an' drive my pigs ter Col'
Water Gap, whar I'll stay an' fish. Soon as I am well
gone, you take dis letter ter Anniky; but <i>min'</i>, don't tell
whar I's gone. An' if she takes it all right, an' promises
ter let me alone, you write me a letter, an' I'll git de fust
Methodis' preacher I run across in der woods ter read it ter
me. Den, ef it's all right, I'll come back an' weed yer
flower-garden fur yer as purty as preachin'."</p>

<p>I agreed to do all uncle Ned asked, and we parted like
conspirators. The next morning Uncle Ned was missing,
and, after waiting a reasonable time I explained the matter
to my parents, and went over with his letter to Aunt
Anniky.</p>

<p>"Powers above!" was her only comment as I got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>
through the remarkable epistle. Then, after a pause to
collect her thoughts, she seized me by the shoulder, saying:
"Run to yo' pappy, honey, quick, an' ax him ef he's
gwine ter stick ter his bargain 'bout de teef. Yer know he
pintedly said dey wuz a <i>weddin'</i> gif'."</p>

<p>Of course my father sent word that she must keep the
teeth, and my mother added a message of sympathy, with a
present of a pocket-handkerchief to dry Aunt Anniky's tears.</p>

<p>"But it's all right," said that sensible old soul, opening
her piano-lid with a cheerful laugh. "Bless you, chile, it
wuz de teef I wanted, not de man! An', honey, you jes'
sen' word to dat shif'less old nigger, ef you know whar he's
gone, to come back home and git his crap in de groun';
an', as fur as <i>I'm</i> consarned, yer jes' let him know dat I
wouldn't pick him up wid a ten-foot pole, not ef he wuz to
beg me on his knees till de millennial day."&mdash;<i>From
"Dialect Tales," published in 1883 by Harper Brothers.</i></p>

<p>It is not easy to tell what satire is, or where it originated.
"In Eden," says Dryden, "the husband and wife excused
themselves by laying the blame on each other, and
gave a beginning to those conjugal dialogues in prose which
poets have perfected in verse." Whatever it may be, we
know it when it cuts us, and Sherwood Bonner's hit on the
Radical Club of Boston was almost inexcusable.</p>

<p>She was admitted as a guest, and her subsequent ridicule
was a violation of all good breeding. But like so many
wicked things it is captivating, and while you are shocked,
you laugh. While I hold up both hands in horror, I intend
to give you an idea of it; leaving out the most personal
verses.</p>

<p class="center">BY SHERWOOD BONNER.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Dear friends, I crave attention to some facts that I shall mention<br /></span>
<span class="i2">About a Club called "Radical," you haven't heard before;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Got up to teach the nation was this new light federation,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To teach the nation how to think, to live, and to adore;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To teach it of the heights and depths that all men should explore;<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Only this and nothing more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">It is not my inclination, in this brief communication,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To produce a false impression&mdash;which I greatly would deplore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But a few remarks I'm makin' on some notes a chiel's been takin,'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, if I'm not mistaken, they'll make your soul upsoar,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As you bend your eyes with eagerness to scan these verses o'er;<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Truly this and something more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">And first, dear friends, the fact is, I'm sadly out of practice,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And may fail in doing justice to this literary bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But when I do begin it, I don't think 'twill take a minute<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To prove there's nothing in it (as you've doubtless heard before),<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But a free religious wrangling club&mdash;of this I'm very sure&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Only this and nothing more!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">'Twas a very cordial greeting, one bright morning of their meeting;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Such eager salutations were never heard before.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">After due deliberation on the importance of the occasion,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To begin the organization, Mr. Pompous took the floor<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With an air quite self-complacent, strutted up and took the floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">As he'd often done before!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">With an air of condescension he bespoke their close attention<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To an essay from a Wiseman versed in theologic lore;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He himself had had the pleasure of a short glance at the treasure,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And in no stinted measure said we had a treat in store;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then he waved his hand to Wiseman and resigned to him the floor;<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Only this and nothing more.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Quick and nervous, short and wiry, with a look profound, yet fiery,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mr. Wiseman now stepped forward and eyed us darkly o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then an arm-chair, quaint and olden, gay with colors green and golden,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By the pretty hostess rolled in from its place behind the door,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was offered to the reader, in the centre of the floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And he took the chair be sure.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Then with arguments elastic, and a voice and eye sarcastic,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mr. Wiseman into flinders the Holy Bible tore;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And he proved beyond all question that the God of Moses' mention<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was a fraudulent invention of some Hebrews, three or four,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the Son of God's ascension an imaginary soar!<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Only this and nothing more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Each member then admitted that his part was well acquitted,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For his strong, impassioned reasoning had touched them to the core;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He felt sure, as he surveyed them through his specs, that he had "played" them,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And was proud that he had made them all astonished by his lore;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Not a continental cared he for the fruits such lessons bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">So he bowed and left the floor.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Then a Colonel, cold and smiling, with a stately air beguiling,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who punctuates his paragraphs on Newport's sounding shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Said his friend was wise and witty, and yet it seemed a pity<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To destroy in this old city the belief it had before<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the ancient superstitions of the days of yore.<br /></span>
<span class="i5">This he said, and something more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Orthodoxy, he lamented, thought the Christian world demented,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet still he felt a rev'rence as he read the Bible o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And he thought the modern preacher, though a poor stick for a teacher,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or a broken reed, like Beecher, ought to have his claims looked o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the "tyranny of science" was indeed, he felt quite sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i5"><i>Our</i> danger more and more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">His remarks our pulses quicken, when a British Lion, stricken<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With his wondrous self-importance&mdash;he knew everything and more&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Said he <i>loathed</i> such moderation; and he made his declaration<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>
<span class="i2">That, in spite of all creation, he found no God to adore;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And his voice was like the ocean as its surges loudly roar;<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Only this and nothing more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<hr class="hr3" />
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">But the interest now grew lukewarm, for an ancient Concord book-worm<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With authoritative tramping, forward came and took the floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And in Orphic mysticisms talked of life and light and prisms,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the Infinite baptisms on a transcendental shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the concrete metaphysic, till we yawned in anguish sore;<br /></span>
<span class="i5">But still he kept the floor.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Then uprose a kindred spirit almost ready to inherit<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The rare and radiant Aiden that he begged us to adore;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His smile was beaming brightly, and his soft hair floated whitely<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Round a face as fair and sightly as a pious priest's of yore;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And we forgave the arguments worn out years before,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">For we loved this saintly bore.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<hr class="hr3" />
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Then a lively little charmer, noted as a dress reformer,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Because that mystic garment, chemiloon, she wore,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Said she had no "views" of Jesus, and therefore would not tease us,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But that she thought 'twould please us to look her figure o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For she wore no bustles <i>anywhere</i>, and corsets, she felt sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Should squeeze her <i>nevermore</i>.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">This pretty little pigeon said of course the true religion<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Demanded ease of body before the mind could soar;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But that no emancipation could come unto our nation<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Until the aggregation of the clothes that women wore<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Were suspended from the shoulders, and smooth with many a gore,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Plain behind and plain before!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Her remarks were full of reason, but a little out of season,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the proper tone of talking Mr. Fairman did restore,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When he sneered at priests and preaching, and indorsed the <i>Index</i> teaching,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And with philanthropic screeching, said he sought for evermore<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The light of sense and freedom into darkened minds to pour;<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Truly this, but something more!<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Then with eyes as bright as Ph&oelig;bus, and hair dark as Erebus,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A maid with stunning eye-glass next appeared upon the floor;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In her aspect she looked regal, though her words were few and feeble,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But she vowed his logic legal and as pure as golden ore,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And indorsed the <i>Index</i> editor in every word he swore,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And then&mdash;said nothing more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Then a tall and red-faced member, large and loose and somewhat limber<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Then a rarely gifted mortal, to whom the triple portal<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of Music, Art, and Poesy had opened years before,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With a look of sombre feeling, depths within his soul revealing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Leaving room for no appealing, he decided o'er and o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The old, old vexing questions of the <i>why</i> and the <i>wherefore</i>,<br /></span>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>Mary Clemmer Hudson has spoken of Ph&oelig;be Cary as
"the wittiest woman in America." But she truly adds:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span></p>

<p>"A flash of wit, like a flash of lightning, can only be
remembered, it cannot be reproduced. Its very marvel
lies in its spontaneity and evanescence; its power is in
being struck from the present. Divorced from that, the
keenest representation of it seems cold and dead. We read
over the few remaining sentences which attempt to embody
the repartees and <i>bon mots</i> of the most famous wits of
society, such as Beau Nash, Beau Brummel, Madame du
Deffand, and Lady Mary Montagu; we wonder at the poverty
of these memorials of their fame. Thus it must be
with Ph&oelig;be Cary. Her most brilliant sallies were perfectly
unpremeditated, and by herself never repeated or
remembered. When she was in her best moods they came
like flashes of heat lightning, like a rush of meteors, so
suddenly and constantly you were dazzled while you were
delighted, and afterward found it difficult to single out any
distinct flash or separate meteor from the multitude....
This most wonderful of her gifts can only be represented
by a few stray sentences gleaned here and there from the
faithful memories of loving friends....</p>

<p>"One tells how, at a little party, where fun rose to a
great height, one quiet person was suddenly attacked by a
gay lady with the question: 'Why don't you laugh? You
sit there just like a post!'</p>

<p>"'There! she called you a post; why don't you rail at
her?' was Ph&oelig;be's quick exclamation.</p>

<p>"Mr. Barnum mentioned to her that the skeleton man
and the fat woman then on exhibition in his 'greatest show
on earth' were married.</p>

<p>"'I suppose they loved through thick and thin,' was her
comment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span></p>
<p>"'On one occasion, when Ph&oelig;be was at the Museum
looking about at the curiosities,' says Mr. Barnum, 'I preceded
her and had passed down a couple of steps. She,
intently watching a big anaconda in a case at the top of the
stairs, walked off, not noticing them, and fell. I was just
in time to catch her in my arms and save her from a good
bruising.'</p>

<p>"'I am more lucky than that first woman was who fell
through the influence of the serpent,' said Ph&oelig;be, as she
recovered herself.</p>

<p>"And when asked by some one at a dinner-party what
brand of champagne they kept, she replied: 'Oh, we drink
Heidsieck, but we keep Mum.'</p>

<p>"Again, a certain well-known actor, then recently deceased,
and more conspicuous for his professional skill than
for his private virtues, was discussed. 'We shall never,'
remarked some one, 'see &mdash;&mdash; again.'</p>

<p>"'No,' quietly responded Ph&oelig;be, 'not unless we go to
the pit.'"</p>

<p>These stray shots may not fairly represent Miss Cary's
brilliancy, but we are grateful for what has been preserved,
meagre as it would seem to those who had the privilege of
knowing her intimately and enjoying those Sunday evening
receptions, where, unrestrained and happy, every one was
at his best.</p>

<p>Her verses on the subject of Woman's Rights, as discussed
in masculine fashion, with masculine logic, by Chanticleer
Dorking, are capital, and her parodies, shockingly
literal, have been widely copied. Enjoy these as given in
her life, written by Mary Clemmer.</p>

<p>I will now offer you some good things of various degrees
of humor. I do not feel it necessary to impress their merits
upon you, for they speak for themselves Here is a quaint
bit of satire from a bright Boston woman, which those on
her side of the vexed Indian question will enjoy:</p>

<h3><a name="THE_INDIAN_AGENT" id="THE_INDIAN_AGENT"></a>THE INDIAN AGENT.</h3>

<p class="center">BY LOUISA HALL.</p>

<p>He was a long, lean man, with a sad expression, as if
weighed down by pity for poor humanity. His heart was
evidently a great many sizes too large for him. He yearned
to enfold all tribes and conditions of men in his encircling
arms. He surveyed his audience with such affectionate interest
that he seemed to look into the very depths of their
pockets.</p>

<p>A few resolute men buttoned their coats, but the majority
knew that this artifice would not save them, and they
rather enjoyed it as a species of harmless dissipation.
They liked to be talked into a state of exhilaration which
obliged them to give without thinking much about it, and
they felt very good and benevolent afterward. So they
cheered the agent enthusiastically, as a signal for him to
begin, and he came forward bowing, while the three red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span>
brothers who accompanied him remained seated on the
platform. He appeared to smile on every one present as
he said:</p>

<p>"Friends and Fellow-Citizens, I have the honor to introduce
to you these chiefs of the Laughing Dog Nation.
Twenty-five years ago this tribe was one of the fiercest on
our Western plains. Snarling Bear, the most noted chief
of his tribe, was a great warrior. Fifty scalps adorned his
wigwam. Some of them had once belonged to his best
friends. He was murdered while in the prime of life by a
white man whose wife he had accidentally shot at the door
of her cabin. He was one of the first to welcome the white
men and adopt the improvements they brought with them.
When he became sufficiently civilized to understand that
polygamy was unlawful, he separated from his oldest wife.
Her scalp was carefully preserved among those of the great
warriors he had conquered. His son, Flying Deer, who is
with us to-day, will address you in his own language, which
I shall interpret for you. The last twenty years have made
a great change in their condition. These men are not
savages, but educated gentlemen. They are all graduates
of Tomahawk College, at Bloody Mountain, near the Gray
Wolf country. They are chiefs of their tribes, each one
holding a position equal to the Governor of our own State.
Their influence at the West is great. Last year they sent a
small party of missionaries to the highlands of the Wolf
country, where the women and children pasture the ponies
during the dry season. Not one of these noble men ever
returned. Unfortunately for the success of this mission,
the Gray Wolf warriors were at home. The medicine
man's dreams had been unfavorable, and they dared not set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg&nbsp;105]</a></span>
out on their annual hunt. This year they will send a larger
party well armed.</p>

<p>"These devoted men have left their Western homes and
come here to assure you of their confidence in your affection,
and the love and gratitude they feel toward you.
They come to ask for churches and schools, that their children
may grow up like yours. But these things require
money. On account of the great scarcity of stone in the
Rocky Mountains, and the necessity of preserving standing
timber for the Indian hunting-grounds, all building materials
for churches and school-houses must be carried from
the East at great expense. The door-steps of the third
orthodox Kickapoo church cost one hundred and fifty dollars.
But it is money well invested. The gradual decrease
of crime at the West has convinced the most sceptical that
a great work can be done among these people. The number
of murders committed in this country last year was one
hundred and twenty-five; this year only one hundred and
twenty-three.</p>

<p>"Although a great deal has been done for these people,
you will be surprised to learn how much remains to be
done. I need not tell you that every dollar intrusted to me
will be spent, and I hope you will live to see the result of
your generosity.</p>

<p>"I wish to build at least fifteen churches and school-houses
before the cold weather sets in. The cost of building
has been greatly lessened by employing native workmen,
who are capable of designing and erecting simple edifices.
The pulpits will be supplied by native preachers,
and the expense of light and heat will be paid by the congregation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span></p>

<p>"We have at least twenty-five well-qualified native
teachers, who will require no salary beyond the necessary
expense of food and clothing.</p>

<p>"A few boarding-houses must be built and tastefully
furnished. We have a large number of Laughing Dog
widows, who would gladly take charge of such establishments.</p>

<p>"The native committee will make a careful selection of
such matrons as are most capable of guiding and encouraging
young people.</p>

<p>"All money for the benefit of these people has been used
with the strictest economy; and will be while I retain the
agency. I have secured a slender provision for my declining
years, and shall return to spend my days with my
adopted people.</p>

<p>"But I will let these men who once owned this great
country speak for themselves. Flying Deer, who will now
address you, is about forty years of age. He lives with his
wife and ten children near the agency, at a place called
Humanketchet."</p>

<p>Flying Deer came forward and spoke very distinctly,
though rapidly.</p>

<p>"O hoo bree-gutchee, gumme maw choo kibbe showain
nemeshin. Dawmasse choochugah goo waugh; kawboo.
Nokka brewis goo, honowin nudwag moonoo shugh kawmun
menjeis. Babas kwasind waugh muskoday, wawa gessonwon

<p>"He says, my friends, that he has always loved and
trusted the white people. He says that since he has seen
the great cities and towns of the East, he loves his white
brothers more than before. His red brothers, White Crow
and the Rock on End, wish him to say that they also love
you. He says the savage Gray Wolf tribe threaten to shoot
and scalp them if they continue friendly to the whites. He
asks for powder, guns, and ponies, that they may defend
themselves from their enemies. He wants to convince you
that they are rapidly becoming a civilized nation. The
assistance you are about to give will only be required for a
short time. They will soon become self-supporting, and
relieve the Government of a heavy tax. They thank you
for the kindness you have shown, and for the generous collection
which will now be taken up.</p>

<p>"Will some friend close the doors while we give every
one an opportunity to contribute to this good cause? Remember
that he who shutteth up his ears to the cry of the
poor, he shall also cry himself and shall not be heard.
Those who prefer can leave a check with Deacon Meekham
at the door, or with me at the hotel. These substantial
tokens of your regard will cause the wilderness to blossom
as the rose.</p>

<p>"In the name of our red brethren, let me again thank
you."</p>

<h3><a name="THE_OLD-TIME_RELIGION" id="THE_OLD-TIME_RELIGION"></a>THE OLD-TIME RELIGION.</h3>

<p class="center">BY JULIA PICKERING.</p>

<p><i>Brother Simon.</i> I say, Brover Horace, I hearn you give
Meriky de terriblest beating las' nite. What you and she
hab a fallin'-out about?</p>

<p><i>Brother Horace.</i> Well, Brover Simon, you knows yourself
I never has no dejection to splanifying how I rules my
folks at home, and 'stablishes order dar when it's p'intedly
needed; and 'fore gracious! I leab you to say dis time ef
'twant needed, and dat pow'ful bad.</p>

<p>You see, I'se allers been a plain, straight-sided nigger,
an' hain't never had no use for new fandangles, let it be
what it mout; 'ligion, polytix, bisness&mdash;don't ker what.
Ole Horace say: "De ole way am de bes' way, an' you
niggers dat's all runnin' teetotleum crazy 'bout ebery new
gimerack dat's started, better jes' stay whar you is and let
them things alone." But dey won't do it; no 'mount of
preaching won't sarve um. And dat is jes' at this partickeler
pint dat Meriky got dat dressin'. She done been off to
Richmun town, a-livin' in sarvice dar dis las' winter, and
Saturday a week ago she camed home ter make a visit.
Course we war all glad to see our darter. But you b'l'eve
dat gal hadn't turned stark bodily naked fool? Yes, sir;
she wa'n't no more like de Meriky dat went away jes' a few
munts ago dan chalk's like cheese. Dar she come in wid
her close pinned tight enuff to hinder her from squattin',
an' her ha'r a-danglin' right in her eyes, jes' for all de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg&nbsp;115]</a></span>
worl' like a ram a-looking fru a brush-pile, and you think
dat nigger hain't forgot how to talk! She jes' rolled up
her eyes ebery oder word, and fanned and talked like she
'spected to die de nex' breff. She'd toss dat mush-head ob
hern and talk proper as two dixunarys. 'Stead ob she call-in'
ob me "daddy" and her mudder "mammy," she say:
"Par and mar, how can you bear to live in sech a one-hoss
town as this? Oh! I think I should die." And right
about dar she hab all de actions ob an' old drake in a thunder-storm.
I jes' stared at dat gal tell I make her out, an'
says I to myself: "It's got to come;" but I don't say
nothin' to nobody 'bout it&mdash;all de same I knowed it had to
come fus' as las'. Well, I jes' let her hab more rope, as de
sayin' is, tell she got whar I 'cluded war 'bout de end ob
her tedder. Dat was on last Sunday mornin', when she
went to meetin' in sich a rig, a-puttin' on airs, tell she
couldn't keep a straight track. When she camed home she
brung kumpny wid her, and, ob course, I couldn't do
nuthin' then; but I jes' kept my ears open, an' ef dat gal
didn't disquollify me dat day, you ken hab my hat.
Bimeby dey all gits to talkin' 'bout 'ligion and de churches,
and den one young buck he step up, an' says he: "Miss
Meriky, give us your 'pinion 'bout de matter." Wid dat
she flung up her head proud as de Queen Victory, an' says
she: "I takes no intelligence in sich matters; dey is all too
common for <i>me</i>. Baptisses is a foot or two below <i>my</i>
grade. I 'tends de 'Pisclopian Church whar I resides, an'
'specs to jine dat one de nex' anniversary ob de bishop.
Oh! dey does eberything so lovely, and in so much style.
I declar' nobody but common folks in de city goes to de
Babtiss Church. It made me sick 't my stomuck to see so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>
much shoutin' and groanin' dis mornin'; 'tis so ungenteel
wid us to make so much sarcumlocutions in meetin'."
And thar she went a-giratin' 'bout de preacher a-comin'
out in a white shirt, and den a-runnin' back and gittin' on
a black one, and de people a-jumpin' up and a-jawin' ob de
preacher outen a book, and a-bowin' ob deir heads, and
a-saying long rigmaroles o' stuff, tell my head fairly buzzed,
and were dat mad at de gal I jes' couldn't see nuffin' in dat
room. Well, I jes' waited tell the kumpny riz to go, and
den I steps up, and says I: "Young folks, you needn't let
what Meriky told you 'bout dat church put no change inter
you. She's sorter out ob her right mine now, but de nex'
time you comes she'll be all right on dat and seberal oder
subjicks;" and den dey stared at Meriky mighty hard and
goed away.</p>

<p>Well, I jes' walks up to her, and I says: "Darter,"
says I, "what chu'ch are dat you say you gwine to jine?"
And says she, very prompt like: "De 'Pisclopian, pa."
And says I: "Meriky, I'se mighty consarned 'bout you,
kase I knows your mine ain't right, and I shall jes' hab to
bring you roun' de shortest way possible." So I retch me a
fine bunch of hick'ries I done prepared for dat 'casion. And
den she jumped up, and says she: "What make you think
I loss my senses?" "Bekase, darter, you done forgot how
to walk and to talk, and dem is sure signs." And wid dat
I jes' let in on her tell I 'stonished her 'siderably. 'Fore I
were done wid her she got ober dem dying a'rs, and jumped
as high as a hopper-grass. Bimeby she 'gins to holler:
"Oh, Lordy, daddy! daddy! don't give me no more."</p>

<p>And says I: "You're improvin', dat's a fac'; done got
your natural voice back. What chu'ch does you 'long to,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span>
Meriky?" And says she, a-cryin': "I don't 'long to
none, par."</p>

<p>Well, I gib her anodder leetle tetch, and says I: "What
chu'ch does you 'long to, darter?" And says she, all
choked like: "I doesn't 'long to none."</p>

<p>Den I jes' make dem hick'ries ring for 'bout five minutes,
and den I say: "What chu'ch you 'longs to now,
Meriky?" And says she, fairly shoutin': "Baptiss; I'se
a deep-water Baptiss." "Berry good," says I. "You
don't 'spect to hab your name tuck offen dem chu'ch
books?" And says she: "No, sar; I allus did despise
dem stuck-up 'Pisclopians; dey ain't got no 'ligion
nohow."</p>

<p>Brover Simon, you never see a gal so holpen by a good
genteel thrashin' in all your days. I boun' she won't neber
stick her nose in dem new-fandangle chu'ches no more.
Why, she jes' walks as straight dis morning, and looks as
peart as a sunflower. I'll lay a tenpence she'll be a-singin'

ob. You knows, Brover Simon, how de words run:</p>

<h3><a name="AUNTY_DOLEFULS_VISIT" id="AUNTY_DOLEFULS_VISIT"></a>AUNTY DOLEFUL'S VISIT.</h3>

<p class="center">BY MARY KYLE DALLAS.</p>

<p>How do you do, Cornelia? I heard you were sick, and
I stepped in to cheer you up a little. My friends often
say: "It's such a comfort to see you, Aunty Doleful.
You have such a flow of conversation, and <i>are</i> so lively."
Besides, I said to myself, as I came up the stairs: "Perhaps
it's the last time I'll ever see Cornelia Jane alive."</p>

<p>You don't mean to die yet, eh? Well, now, how do you
know? You can't tell. You think you are getting better,
but there was poor Mrs. Jones sitting up, and every one
saying how smart she was, and all of a sudden she was
taken with spasms in the heart, and went off like a flash.
Parthenia is young to bring the baby up by hand. But you
must be careful, and not get anxious or excited. Keep
quite calm, and don't fret about anything. Of course,
things can't go on jest as if you were down-stairs; and I
wondered whether you knew your little Billy was sailing
about in a tub on the mill-pond, and that your little Sammy
was letting your little Jimmy down from the veranda-roof
in a clothes-basket.</p>

<p>Gracious goodness, what's the matter? I guess Providence'll
take care of 'em. Don't look so. You thought
Bridget was watching them? Well, no, she isn't. I saw
her talking to a man at the gate. He looked to me like a
burglar. No doubt she'll let him take the impression of
the door-key in wax, and then he'll get in and murder you
all. There was a family at Bobble Hill all killed last week<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg&nbsp;119]</a></span>
for fifty dollars. Now, don't fidget so; it will be bad for
the baby.</p>

<p>Poor, little dear! How singular it is, to be sure, that
you can't tell whether a child is blind, or deaf and dumb,
or a cripple at that age. It might be <i>all</i>, and you'd never
know it.</p>

<p>Most of them that have their senses make bad use of
them though; <i>that</i> ought to be your comfort, if it does
turn out to have anything dreadful the matter with it.
And more don't live a year. I saw a baby's funeral down
the street as I came along.</p>

<p>How is Mr. Kobble? Well, but finds it warm in town,
eh? Well, I should think he would. They are dropping
down by hundreds there with sun-stroke. You must prepare
your mind to have him brought home any day. Anyhow,
a trip on these railroad trains is just risking your life
every time you take one. Back and forth every day as he
is, it's just trifling with danger.</p>

<p>Dear! dear! now to think what dreadful things hang
over us all the time! Dear! dear!</p>

<p>Scarlet fever has broken out in the village, Cornelia.
Little Isaac Potter has it, and I saw your Jimmy playing
with him last Saturday.</p>

<p>Well, I must be going now. I've got another sick
friend, and I sha'n't think my duty done unless I cheer her
up a little before I sleep. Good-by. How pale you look,
Cornelia! I don't believe you have a good doctor. Do
send him away and try some one else. You don't look so
well as you did when I came in. But if anything happens,
send for me at once. If I can't do anything else, I can
cheer you up a little.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="center">PROSE, BUT NOT PROSY.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alice Wellington Rollins, in those interesting articles
in the <i>Critic</i> which induced me to look further, says:</p>

<p>"We claim high rank for the humor of women because
it is almost exclusively of this higher, imaginative type. A
woman rarely tells an anecdote, or hoards up a good story,
or comes in and describes to you something funny that she
has seen. Her humor is like a flash of lightning from a
clear sky, coming when you least expect it, when it could
not have been premeditated, and when, to the average consciousness,
there is not the slightest provocation to humor,
possessing thus in the very highest degree that element of
surprise which is not only a factor in all humor, but to our
mind the most important factor. You tell her that you
cannot spend the winter with her because you have promised
to spend it with some one else, and she exclaims:
'Oh, Ellen! why were you not born twins!' She has,
perhaps, recently built for herself a most charming home,
and coming to see yours, which happens to be just a trifle
more luxurious and charming, she remarks as she turns
away: 'All I can say is, when you want to see <i>squalor</i>,
come and visit me in Oxford Street!' She puts down her
heavy coffee-cup of stone-china with its untasted coffee at
a little country inn, saying, with a sigh: 'It's no use; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span>
can't get at it; it's like trying to drink over a stone wall.'
She writes in a letter: 'We parted this morning with
mutual satisfaction; that is, I suppose we did; I know my
satisfaction was mutual enough for two.' She asks her
little restless daughter in the most insinuating tones if she
would not like to sit in papa's lap and have him tell her
a story; and when the little daughter responds with a
most uncompromising 'no!' turns her inducement into a
threat, and remarks with severity: 'Well, be a good girl,
or you will have to!' She complains, when you have kept
her waiting while you were buying undersleeves, that you
must have bought 'undersleeves enough for a centipede.'
You ask how poor Mr. X&mdash;&mdash; is&mdash;the disconsolate widower
who a fortnight ago was completely prostrated by his wife's
death, and are told in calm and even tones that he is 'beginning
to take notice.' You tell her that one of the best
fellows in the class has been unjustly expelled, and that the
class are to wear crape on their left arms for thirty days,
and that you only hope that the President will meet you in
the college-yard and ask why you wear it; to all of which
she replies soothingly, 'I wouldn't do that, Henry; for the
President might tell you not to mourn, as your friend was
not lost, only <i>gone before</i>.' You tell her of your stunned
sensation on finding some of your literary work complimented
in the <i>Nation</i>, and she exclaims: 'I should think
so! It must be like meeting an Indian and seeing him put
his hand into his no-pocket to draw out a scented pocket-handkerchief,
instead of a tomahawk.' Or she writes that
two Sunday-schools are trying to do all the good they can,
but that each is determined at any cost to do more good
than the other."</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>I have selected several specimens of this higher type of
humor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ellen H. Rollins was pre-eminently gifted in this
direction. The humor in her exquisite "New England
Bygones" is so interwoven with the simple pathos of her
memories that it cannot be detached without detriment to
both. But I will venture to select three sketches from</p>

<h3><a name="OLD-TIME_CHILD_LIFE" id="OLD-TIME_CHILD_LIFE"></a>OLD-TIME CHILD LIFE.</h3>

<p class="center">BY E.H. ARR.</p>

<p>Betsy had the reddest hair of any girl I ever knew. It
was quite short in front, and she had a way of twisting it,
on either temple, into two little buttons, which she fastened
with pins. The rest of it she brought quite far up on the
top of her head, where she kept it in place with a large-sized
horn comb. Her face was covered with freckles, and
her eyes, in winter, were apt to be inflamed. She always
seemed to have a mop in her hand, and she had no respect
for paint. She was as neat as old Dame Safford herself,
and was continually "straightening things out," as she
called it. Her temper, like her hair, was somewhat fiery;
and when her work did not suit her, she was prone to a
gloomy view of life. If she was to be believed, things
were always "going to wrack and ruin" about the house;
and she had a queer way of taking time by the forelock.
In the morning it was "going on to twelve o'clock," and
at noon it was "going on to midnight."</p>

<p>She kept her six kitchen chairs in a row on one side of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>the room, and as many flatirons in a line on the mantelpiece.
Everything where she was had, she said, to "stand
just so;" and woe to the child who carried crookedness into
her straight lines! Betsy had a manner of her own, and
made a wonderful kind of a courtesy, with which her skirts
puffed out all around like a cheese. She always courtesied
to Parson Meeker when she met him, and said: "I hope
to see you well, sir." Once she courtesied in a prayer-meeting
to a man who offered her a chair, and told him, in
a shrill voice, to "keep his setting," though she was "ever
so much obleeged" to him. This was when she was under
conviction, and Parson Meeker said he thought she had met
with a change of heart. Father Lathem's wife hoped so
too, for then "there would be a chance of having some
Long-noses and Pudding-sweets left over in the orchard."</p>

<p>It was in time of the long drought, when fire ran over
Grayface, and a great comet appeared in the sky. Some of
the people of Whitefield thought the world was coming to
an end. The comet stayed for weeks, visible even at noon-day,
stretching its tail from the zenith far toward the western
horizon, and at night staring in at windows with its eye
of fire. It was the talk of the people, who pondered over
it with a helpless wonder. I recall two Whitefield women
as they stood, one morning, bare-armed in a doorway, staring
at and chattering about it. One says they "might as
well stop work" and "take it easy" while they can. The
other thinks the better way is to "keep on a stiddy jog
until it comes." They wish they knew "how near it is,"
and "what the tail means anyway."</p>

<p>Betsy comes along with a pail, which she sets down, and
then looks up to the comet. The air is dense with smoke
from Grayface, and the dry earth is full of cracks. Betsy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg&nbsp;126]</a></span>
declares that it is "going on two months since there has
been any rain." Everything is "going to wrack and
ruin," and "if that thing up there should burst, there'll be
an end to Whitefield."</p>

<p>Then she catches sight of me listening wide-mouthed,
and she tells me that I needn't suppose she is "going home
to iron my pink muslin," for she thinks the tail of the
comet "has started, and is coming right down to whisk it
off from the line." I believe her, and distinctly remember
the terror that took hold of me as I rushed home and tore
the pink muslin from the line, lest it should be whisked off
by the comet's tail.</p>

<p>When the drought broke, a single day's rain washed all
the smoke from the air. Directly, the tail of the comet
began to fade, and all of a sudden its fiery eye went out
of the sky.</p>

<p>Some of the villagers thought it had "burst," others that
it had "burned out." Betsy said: "Whatever it was, it
was a humbug;" and the wisest man in Whitefield could
neither tell whence it came nor whither it went. One
thing, however, was certain: Farmer Lathem said that
never, since his orchard began to bear, had he gathered
such a crop of apples as he did, despite the drought, in the
year of the great comet.</p>

<h3><a name="MRS_MEEKER" id="MRS_MEEKER"></a>MRS. MEEKER.</h3>

<p class="center">BY E.H. ARR.</p>

<p>When I read of Roman matrons I always think of Mrs.
Meeker. Her features were marked, and her eyes of deepest
blue. She wore her hair combed closely down over her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg&nbsp;127]</a></span>
ears, so that her forehead seemed to run up in a point high
upon her head: Its color was of reddish-brown, and, I am
sorry to say, so far as it was seen, it was not her own. It
was called a scratch, and Betsy said Mrs. Meeker "would
look enough sight better if she would leave it off." Whether
any hair at all grew upon Mrs. Meeker's head was a great
problem with the village children, and nothing could better
illustrate the dignity of this woman than the fact that for
more than thirty years the whole neighborhood tried in
vain to find out.</p>

came an application, with an exhortation at its close. The
sermons were called very able, or, more often, "strong discourses."
I used to think this was because Mrs. Meeker
had stitched their leaves fast together. Betsy said they
were just like Deacon Saunders's breaking-up plough,
"and went tearing right through sin." The parson, when
I knew him, was a little slow of speech and dull of sight.
He sometimes lost his place on his page. How afraid I
used to be lest, not finding it, he should repeat his heads!
He always brought himself up with a jerk, however, and
sailed safely through to the application.</p>

<p>When that came, Benny almost always gave me a jog with
his elbow or foot. Once he stuck a pin into my arm,
which made me jump so that Deacon Saunders, who sat
behind, waked up with a loud snort. The deacon was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg&nbsp;128]</a></span>
always talking about the sermons being "powerful in doctrine."
When Benny asked Betsy what doctrines were,
she told him to "let doctrines alone;" that they were
"pizen things, only fit for hardened old sinners."</p>

<p>There are many delightful articles which must be merely
alluded to in passing, as the "Old Salem Shops," by
Eleanor Putnam, so delicate and delicious that, once read,
it will ever be a fragrant memory; Louise Stockton's
"Woman in the Restaurant" I want to give you, and Mrs.
Barrow's "Pennikitty People;" a chapter from Miss Baylor's
"On This Side," and the opening chapters of Miss
Phelps's "Old Maids' Paradise;" also the description of
"Joppa," by Grace Denio Litchfield, in "Only an Incident."
There are others from which it is not possible to
make extracts. Miss Woolson's admirable "For the Major,"
though pathetic, almost tragic, in its underlying feeling,
is, at the same time, a story of exquisite humor, from
which, nevertheless, not a single sentence could be quoted
that would be called "funny." Her work, and that of
Frances Hodgson Burnett, as well as that of Miss Phelps
and Mrs. Spofford, shine with a silver thread of humor,
worked too intimately into the whole warp and woof to be
extracted without injuring both the solid material and the
tinsel. To appreciate the point and delicacy of their finest
wit, you must read the whole story and grasp the entire
character or situation.</p>

<p>Mrs. E.W. Bellamy, a Southern lady, published in last
year's <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> a sketch called "At Bent's
Hotel," which ought to have a place in this volume; but
my publisher says authoritatively that there must be a limit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg&nbsp;129]</a></span>
somewhere; so this gem must be included in&mdash;a second
series!</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>There is so much truth as well as humor in the following
article, that it must be included. It gives in prose the
agonies which Saxe told so feelingly in verse:</p>

<h3><a name="A_FATAL_REPUTATION" id="A_FATAL_REPUTATION"></a>A FATAL REPUTATION.</h3>

<p class="center">BY ISABEL FRANCES BELLOWS.</p>

<p>I am impelled to write this as an awful warning to young
men and women who are just entering upon life and its
responsibilities. Years ago I thoughtlessly took a false
step, which at the time seemed trivial and of little import,
but which has since assumed colossal proportions that
threaten to overshadow much of the innocent happiness of
my otherwise placid existence. What wonder, then, that I
try to avert this danger from young and inexperienced
minds who in their gay thoughtlessness rush into the very
jaws of the disaster, and before they are well aware find
they are entrapped for life, as there is no escape for those
who have thus brought their doom upon themselves.</p>

<p>I will try and relate how, like the Lady of Shalott, when
I first began to gaze upon the world of realities "the
curse" came upon me. It was in this wise:</p>

<p>I lived in my youth an almost cloistral life of seclusion
and self-absorption, from which I was suddenly shaken by
circumstances, and forced to mingle in the busy world; to
which, after the first shock, I was not at all averse, but
found very interesting, and also&mdash;and there was the weight
that pulled me down&mdash;tolerably amusing. For I met some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span>curious people, and saw and heard some remarkable things;
and as I went among my friends I often used to give an
account of my observations, until at last I discovered that
wherever I went, and under whatever circumstances (except,
of course, at the funeral of a member of the family),
I was expected to be amusing! I found myself in the same
relation to society that the clown bears to the circus-master
who has engaged him&mdash;he must either be funny or leave
the troupe.</p>

<p>Now, I am unfortunate in having no particular accomplishments.
I cannot sing either the old songs or the new;
neither am I a performer on divers instruments. I can
paint a little, but my paintings do not seem to rouse any
enthusiasm in the beholder, nor do they add an inspiring
strain to conversation. I can, indeed, make gingerbread
and six different kinds of pudding, but I hesitate to mention
it, because the cook is far in advance of me in all these
particulars, not to mention numerous other ways in which
she excels. I have thus but one resource in life; and when
I give one or two instances of the humiliation and distress
of mind to which I have been subjected on its account I am
sure I shall win a sympathizing thought even from those
who are more favored by nature, and possibly save a few
young spirits from the pain of treading in my footsteps.</p>

<p>In the first place, I am not naturally witty. Epigrams
do not rise spontaneously to my lips, and it sometimes takes
days and even weeks of consideration after an opportunity
of making one has occurred before the appropriate words
finally dawn upon me. By that time, of course, the retort
is what the Catholics call "a work of supererogation." I
perhaps possess a slight "sense of the humorous," which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span>has undoubtedly given rise to the fatal demand upon me,
but I do not remember ever having been very funny.
There never was any danger of my experiencing difficulties
like Dr. Holmes on that famous occasion when he was as
funny as he could be. I have often been as funny as I
could be, but the smallest of buttons on the slenderest of
threads never detached itself on my account. I have never
had to restrain my humorous remarks in the slightest degree,
but on the contrary have sometimes been driven into
making the most atrocious jokes, and even puns, because it
was evident something of the sort was expected from me&mdash;only,
of course, something better.</p>

<p>One occurrence of this kind will remain forever fixed in
my memory. I was invited to a picnic, that most ghastly
device of the human mind for playing at having a good
time. At first I had declined to go, but it was represented
to me that no less than three families had company for
whose entertainment something must be done; that two
young and interesting friends of mine just about to be engaged
to each other would be simply inconsolable if the
plan were given up; and, in short, that I should show by
not going an extremely hateful and unseemly spirit&mdash;"besides,
it wouldn't do to have it without you, my dear," continued
my amiable friend, "because you know you are always
the life of the party." So I sighed and consented.</p>

<p>The day arrived, and before nine o'clock in the morning
the mercury stood at ninety degrees in the shade. The
cook overslept herself, and breakfast was so late that William
Henry missed the train into the city, which didn't make
it pleasanter for any of us. I had made an especially delicate
cake to take with me as my share of the feast, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span>while we were at breakfast I heard a crash in the direction
of the kitchen, and hastening tremblingly to discover the
origin of it I found the cake and the plate containing it in
one indistinguishable heap on the floor.</p>

<p>"It slipped between me two hands as if it was alive, bad
luck to it," said the cook; "and it was meself that saw
the heavy crack in the plate before you set the cake onto it,
mum!"</p>

<p>I took cookies and boiled eggs to the picnic.</p>

<p>The wreck had hardly been cleared away before my son
and heir appeared in the doorway with a hole of unimagined
dimensions in his third worst trousers. His second
worst were already in the mending basket, so nothing remained
for me but to clothe him in his best suit and wonder
all day in which part of them I should find the largest hole
when I came home.</p>

<p>Lastly, I had just put on my hat, and was preparing to
set forth, warm, tired and demoralized, when my youngest,
in her anxiety to bid me a sufficiently affectionate farewell,
lost her small balance, and came rolling down-stairs after
me. No serious harm was done, but it took nearly an hour
before I succeeded in soothing and comforting her sufficiently
to be able to leave her, with two brown-paper
patches on her head and elbow, in the care of the nurse.</p>

<p>When I arrived late, discouraged and with a headache, at
the picnic grounds, I found the assembled company sitting
vapidly about among mosquitoes and beetles, already looking
bored to death, and I soon perceived that it was expected
of me to provide amusement and entertainment for
the crowd. I tried to rally, therefore, and proposed a few
games, which went off in a spiritless manner enough, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span>apparently in consequence I began to be assailed with questions
and remarks of a reproachful character.</p>

<p>"Don't you feel well to-day?" "Has anything happened?"
"You don't seem as lively as usual!" No one
took the slightest notice of my explanations, until at last,
goaded into desperation by one evil-minded old woman,
who asked me if it were true that my husband was involved
in the failure of Smith, Jones &amp; Co., I launched out and
became wildly and disgracefully silly. Nothing seemed too
foolish, too senseless to say if it only answered the great
purpose of keeping off the attack of personal questions.</p>

<p>Thus the wretched day wore on, until at last it was time
to go home, and the first feeling approaching content was
stealing into my weary bosom as I gathered up my basket
and shawls, when it was rudely dashed by the following
conversation, conducted by two ladies to whom I had been
introduced that day. They were standing at a little distance
from the rest of the company and from me, and evidently
thought themselves far enough away to talk quite
loud, so that these words were plainly borne to my ears:</p>

<p>"I hate to see people try to make themselves so conspicuous,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed; and to try to be funny when they
haven't any fun in them."</p>

<p>"I can't imagine what Maria was thinking about to call
her witty!"</p>

<p>"I know it. I should think such people had better keep
quiet when they haven't anything to say. I'm glad it's
time to go home. Picnics are such stupid things!"</p>

<p>What more was said I do not know, for I left the spot as
quickly as possible, making an inward resolution to avoid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg&nbsp;134]</a></span>all picnics in the future till I should arrive at my second
childhood.</p>

<p>I cannot refrain from giving one other little instance of
my sufferings from this cause. I was again invited out;
this time to a lunch party, specially to meet the friend of a
friend of mine. The very morning of the day it was to
take place I received a telegram stating that my great-aunt
had died suddenly in California. Now people don't usually
care much about their great-aunts. They can bear to be
chastened in this direction very comfortably; but I did
care about mine. She had been very kind to me, and
though the width of a continent had separated us for the
last ten years her memory was still dear to me.</p>

<p>I sat down immediately to write a note excusing myself
from my friend's lunch party, when, just as I took the
paper, it occurred to me that it was rather a selfish thing to
do. My friend's guests were invited, and her arrangements
all made; and as the visit of her friend was to be very
short the opportunity of our meeting would probably be
lost. So I wrote instead a note to the daughter of my
great aunt, and when the time came I went to the lunch
party with a heavy heart. I had no opportunity of telling
my friend of the sad news I had received that morning,
and I suppose I may have been quiet; perhaps I even
seemed indifferent, though I tried not to be. I could not
have been very successful, however, for I was just going
up-stairs to put on my "things" to go home, when I heard
this little conversation in the dressing-room:</p>

<p>"It's too bad she wasn't more interesting to-day, but
you never can tell how it will be. She will do as she likes,
and that's the end of it."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg&nbsp;135]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes," said another voice, "I think she is rather a
moody person anyway; she won't say a word if she doesn't
feel like it."</p>

<p>"'Sh&mdash;'sh&mdash;here she comes," said another, with the tone
and look that told me it was I of whom they were talking.</p>

<p>And so I adjure all youthful and hopeful persons, who
have a tendency to be funny, to keep it a profound secret
from the world. Indulge in your propensities to any extent
in your family circle; keep your immediate relatives,
if you like, in convulsions of inextinguishable laughter all
the time; but when you mingle in society guard your secret
with your life. Never make a joke, and, if necessary, never
take one; and by so doing you shall peradventure escape
that wrath to come to which I have fallen an innocent victim,
and which I doubt not will bring me to an untimely
end.&mdash;<i>The Independent.</i></p>

<h3><a name="A_BLACKSMITH_IN_LOVE" id="A_BLACKSMITH_IN_LOVE"></a>A BLACKSMITH IN LOVE.</h3>

<p class="center">BY CHARLES EGBERT CRADDOCK.</p>

<p>The pine-knots flamed and glistened under the great
wash-kettle. A tree-toad was persistently calling for rain
in the dry distance. The girl, gravely impassive, beat the
clothes with the heavy paddle. Her mother shortly ceased
to prod the white heaps in the boiling water, and presently
took up the thread of her discourse.</p>

<p>"An' 'Vander hev got ter be a mighty suddint man. I
hearn tell, when I war down ter M'ria's house ter the quiltin',
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg&nbsp;136]</a></span>ez how in that sorter fight an' scrimmage they hed at
the mill las' month, he war powerful ill-conducted. Nobody
hed thought of hevin' much of a fight&mdash;thar hed been
jes' a few licks passed atwixt the men thar; but the fust
finger ez war laid on this boy, he jes' lit out, an' fit like a
catamount. Right an' lef' he lay about him with his fists,
an' he drawed his huntin'-knife on some of 'em. The men
at the mill war in no wise pleased with him."</p>

<p>"'Pears like ter me ez 'Vander air a peaceable boy
enough, ef he ain't jawed at an' air lef' be," drawled
Cynthia.</p>

<p>Her mother was embarrassed for a moment. Then, with
a look both sly and wise, she made an admission&mdash;a qualified
admission. "Waal, wimmen&mdash;ef&mdash;ef&mdash;ef they air young
an' toler'ble hard-headed <i>yit</i>, air likely ter jaw <i>some</i>, ennyhow.
An' a gal oughtn't ter marry a man ez hev sot his
heart on bein' lef' in peace. He is apt ter be a mighty
sour an' disapp'inted critter."</p>

<p>This sudden turn to the conversation invested all that
had been said with new meaning, and revealed a subtle
diplomatic intention. The girl seemed deliberately to
review it as she paused in her work. Then, with a rising
flush: "I ain't studyin' 'bout marryin' nobody," she
asserted staidly. "I hev laid off ter live single."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ware had overshot the mark, but she retorted, gallantly
reckless: "That's what yer Aunt Malviny useter
declar' fur gospel sure, when she war a gal. An' she hev
got ten chil'ren, an' hev buried two husbands; an' ef all
they say air true, she's tollin' in the third man now. She's
a mighty spry, good-featured woman, an' a fust-rate manager,
yer Aunt Malviny air, an' both her husbands lef'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg&nbsp;137]</a></span>her suthin&mdash;cows, or wagons, or land. An' they war quiet
men when they war alive, an' stays whar they air put now
that they air dead; not like old Parson Hoodenpyle, what
his wife hears stumpin' round the house an' preachin' every
night, though she air ez deef ez a post, an' he hev been in
glory twenty year&mdash;twenty year an' better. Yer Aunt
Malviny hed luck, so mebbe 'tain't no killin' complaint fur
a gal ter git ter talking like a fool about marryin' an' sech.
Leastwise I ain't minded ter sorrow."</p>

<p>She looked at her daughter with a gay grin, which, distorted
by her toothless gums and the wreathing steam from
the kettle, enhanced her witch-like aspect and was spuriously
malevolent. She did not notice the stir of an approach
through the brambly tangles of the heights above
until it was close at hand; as she turned, she thought only
of the mountain cattle and to see the red cow's picturesque
head and crumpled horns thrust over the sassafras bushes, or
to hear the brindle's clanking bell. It was certainly less unexpected
to Cynthia when a young mountaineer, clad in
brown jean trousers and a checked homespun shirt, emerged
upon the rocky slope. He still wore his blacksmith's
leather apron, and his powerful corded hammer-arm was
bare beneath his tightly-rolled sleeve. He was tall and
heavily built; his sunburned face was square, with a
strong lower jaw, and his features were accented by fine
lines of charcoal, as if the whole were a clever sketch.</p>

<p>His black eyes held fierce intimations, but there was
mobility of expression about them that suggested changing
impulses, strong but fleeting. He was like his forge-fire;
though the heat might be intense for a time, it fluctuated
with the breath of the bellows. Just now he was meekly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span>quailing before the old woman, whom he evidently had not
thought to find here. It was as apt an illustration as might
be, perhaps, of the inferiority of strength to finesse. She
seemed an inconsiderable adversary, as, haggard, lean, and
prematurely aged, she swayed on her prodding-stick about
the huge kettle; but she was as a veritable David to this
big young Goliath, though she, too, flung hardly more than
a pebble at him.</p>

<p>"Laws-a-me!" she cried, in shrill, toothless glee; "ef
hyar ain't 'Vander Price! What brung ye down hyar
along o' we-uns, 'Vander?" she continued, with simulated
anxiety. "Hev that thar red heifer o' ourn lept over the
fence agin, an' got inter Pete's corn? Waal, sir, ef she
ain't the headin'est heifer!"</p>

<p>"I hain't seen none o' yer heifer, ez I knows on,"
replied the young blacksmith, with gruff, drawling deprecation.
Then he tried to regain his natural manner. "I
kem down hyar," he remarked, in an off-hand way, "ter
git a drink o' water." He glanced furtively at the girl,
then looked quickly away at the gallant red-bird, still gayly
parading among the leaves.</p>

<p>The old woman grinned with delight. "Now, ef that
ain't s'prisin'," she declared. "Ef we hed knowed ez
Lost Creek war a-goin' dry over yander a-nigh the shop, so
ye an' Pete would hev ter kem hyar thirstin' fur water,
we-uns would hev brung suthin' down hyar ter drink out'n.
We-uns hain't got no gourd hyar, hev we, Cynthy?"</p>

<p>"'Thout it air the little gourd with the saft-soap in it,"
said Cynthia, confused and blushing. Her mother broke
into a high, loud laugh.</p>

<p>"Ye ain't wantin' ter gin 'Vander the soap-gourd ter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg&nbsp;139]</a></span>drink out'n, Cynthy! Leastwise, I ain't goin' ter gin it
ter Pete. Fur I s'pose ef ye hev ter kem a haffen mile ter
git a drink, 'Vander, ez surely Pete'll hev ter kem, too.
Waal, waal, who would hev b'lieved ez Lost Creek would
go dry nigh the shop, an' yit be a-scuttlin' along like that
hyarabouts!" and she pointed with her bony finger at the
swift flow of the water.</p>

<p>He was forced to abandon his clumsy pretence of thirst.
"Lost Creek ain't gone dry nowhar, ez I knows on," he
admitted, mechanically rolling the sleeve of his hammer-arm
up and down as he talked.</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>From Miss Woolson's story of "Anne," I give the pen-portrait
of the precise</p>

<h3><a name="MISS_LOIS" id="MISS_LOIS"></a>"MISS LOIS."</h3>

<p>"Codfish balls for breakfast on Sunday morning, of
course," said Miss Lois, "and fried hasty-pudding. On
Wednesdays, a boiled dinner. Pies on Tuesdays and Saturdays."</p>

<p>The pins stood in straight rows on her pincushion; three
times each week every room in the house was swept, and
the floors, as well as the furniture, dusted. Beans were
baked in an iron pot on Saturday night, and sweet-cake
was made on Thursday. Winter or summer, through
scarcity or plenty, Miss Lois never varied her established
routine, thereby setting an example, she said, to the idle
and shiftless. And certainly she was a faithful guide-post,
continually pointing out an industrious and systematic way,
which, however, to the end of time, no French-blooded,
French-hearted person will ever travel, unless dragged by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg&nbsp;140]</a></span>force. The villagers preferred their lake trout to Miss
Lois's salt codfish, their tartines to her corn-meal puddings,
and their <i>eau-de-vie</i> to her green tea; they loved
their disorder and their comfort; her bar soap and scrubbing-brush
were a horror to their eyes. They washed the
household clothes two or three times a year. Was not that
enough? Of what use the endless labor of this sharp-nosed
woman, with glasses over her eyes, at the church-house?
Were not, perhaps, the glasses the consequence of such
toil? And her figure of a long leanness also?</p>

<p>The element of real heroism, however, came into Miss
Lois's life in her persistent effort to employ Indian servants.
Through long years had she persisted, through long
years would she continue to persist. A succession of Chippewa
squaws broke, stole, and skirmished their way through
her kitchen, with various degrees of success, generally in
the end departing suddenly at night with whatever booty
they could lay their hands on. It is but justice to add,
however, that this was not much, a rigid system of keys
and excellent locks prevailing in the well-watched household.
Miss Lois's conscience would not allow her to employ
half-breeds, who were sometimes endurable servants;
duty required, she said, that she should have full-blooded
natives. And she had them. She always began to teach
them the alphabet within three days after their arrival, and
the spectacle of a tearful, freshly-caught Indian girl, very
wretched in her calico dress and white apron, worn out
with the ways of the kettles and the brasses, dejected over
the fish-balls, and appalled by the pudding, standing confronted
by a large alphabet on the well-scoured table, and
Miss Lois by her side with a pointer, was frequent and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg&nbsp;141]</a></span>
regular in its occurrence, the only change being in the personality
of the learners. No one of them had ever gone
through the letters, but Miss Lois was not discouraged.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_CIRCUS_AT_DENBY" id="THE_CIRCUS_AT_DENBY"></a>THE CIRCUS AT DENBY.</h3>

<p class="center">BY SARAH ORNE JEWETT.</p>

<p>I cannot truthfully say that it was a good show; it was
somewhat dreary, now that I think of it quietly and without
excitement. The creatures looked tired, and as if they
had been on the road for a great many years. The animals
were all old, and there was a shabby great elephant whose
look of general discouragement went to my heart, for it
seemed as if he were miserably conscious of a misspent life.
He stood dejected and motionless at one side of the tent,
and it was hard to believe that there was a spark of vitality
left in him. A great number of the people had never seen
an elephant before, and we heard a thin, little old man,
who stood near us, say delightedly: "There's the old
creatur', and no mistake, Ann 'Liza. I wanted to see him
most of anything. My sakes alive, ain't he big!"</p>

<p>And Ann 'Liza, who was stout and sleepy-looking,
droned out: "Ye-es, there's consider'ble of him; but he
looks as if he ain't got no animation."</p>

<p>Kate and I turned away and laughed, while Mrs. Kew
said, confidentially, as the couple moved away: "<i>She</i>
needn't be a reflectin' on the poor beast. That's Mis' Seth
Tanner, and there isn't a woman in Deep Haven nor East
Parish to be named the same day with her for laziness.
I'm glad she didn't catch sight of me; she'd have talked
about nothing for a fortnight." There was a picture of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg&nbsp;142]</a></span>
huge snake in Deep Haven, and I was just wondering
where he could be, or if there ever had been one, when we
heard a boy ask the same question of the man whose thankless
task it was to stir up the lions with a stick to make
them roar. "The snake's dead," he answered, good-naturedly.
"Didn't you have to dig an awful long grave
for him?" asked the boy; but the man said he reckoned
they curled him up some, and smiled as he turned to his
lions, that looked as if they needed a tonic. Everybody
lingered longest before the monkeys, that seemed to be the
only lively creatures in the whole collection....</p>

<p>Coming out of the great tent was disagreeable enough,
and we seemed to have chosen the worst time, for the
crowd pushed fiercely, though I suppose nobody was in the
least hurry, and we were all severely jammed, while from
somewhere underneath came the wails of a deserted dog.
We had not meant to see the side shows; but when we
came in sight of the picture of the Kentucky giantess, we
noticed that Mrs. Kew looked at it wistfully, and we immediately
asked if she cared anything about going to see the
wonder, whereupon she confessed that she never heard of
such a thing as a woman's weighing six hundred and fifty
pounds; so we all three went in. There were only two or
three persons inside the tent, beside a little boy who played
the hand-organ.</p>

<p>The Kentucky giantess sat in two chairs on a platform,
and there was a large cage of monkeys just beyond, toward
which Kate and I went at once. "Why, she isn't more
than two thirds as big as the picture," said Mrs. Kew, in a
regretful whisper; "but I guess she's big enough; doesn't
she look discouraged, poor creatur'?" Kate and I felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg&nbsp;143]</a></span>
ashamed of ourselves for being there. No matter if she
had consented to be carried round for a show, it must have
been horrible to be stared at and joked about day after day;
and we gravely looked at the monkeys, and in a few minutes
turned to see if Mrs. Kew were not ready to come
away, when, to our surprise, we saw that she was talking to
the giantess with great interest, and we went nearer.</p>

<p>"I thought your face looked natural the minute I set
foot inside the door," said Mrs. Kew; "but you've altered
some since I saw you, and I couldn't place you till I heard
you speak. Why, you used to be spare. I am amazed,
Marilly! Where are your folks?"</p>

<p>"I don't wonder you are surprised," said the giantess.
"I was a good ways from this when you knew me, wasn't
I? But father, he ran through with every cent he had before
he died, and 'he' took to drink, and it killed him after
a while; and then I begun to grow worse and worse, till I
couldn't do nothing to earn a dollar, and everybody was
a-coming to see me, till at last I used to ask 'em ten cents
apiece, and I scratched along somehow till this man came
round and heard of me; and he offered me my keep and
good pay to go along with him. He had another giantess
before me, but she had begun to fall away considerable, so
he paid her off and let her go. This other giantess was an
awful expense to him, she was such an eater; now, I don't
have no great of an appetite"&mdash;this was said plaintively&mdash;"and
he's raised my pay since I've been with him because
we did so well." ...</p>

<p>"Have you been living in Kentucky long?" asked Mrs.
Kew. "I saw it on the picture outside."</p>

<p>"No," said the giantess; "that was a picture the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg&nbsp;144]</a></span>
bought cheap from another show that broke up last year.
It says six hundred and fifty pounds, but I don't weigh
more than four hundred. I haven't been weighed for
some time past. Between you and me, I don't weigh as
much as that, but you mustn't mention it, for it would
spoil my reputation and might hinder my getting another
engagement."</p>

<p>Then they shook hands in a way that meant a great deal,
and when Kate and I said good-afternoon, the giantess
looked at us gratefully, and said: "I'm very much obliged
to you for coming in, young ladies."</p>

<p>"Walk in! Walk in!" the man was shouting as we
came away. "Walk in and see the wonder of the world,
ladies and gentlemen&mdash;the largest woman ever seen in
America&mdash;the great Kentucky giantess!"</p>

<p class="center"><i>A Trip of Trials</i>.</p>

<p class="center">BY LOUISE CHANDLER MOULTON.</p>

<p>The Jane Moseley was a disappointment&mdash;most Janes are.
If they had called her Samuel, no doubt she would have
behaved better; but they called her Jane, and the natural
consequences of our mistakes cannot be averted from ourselves
or others. A band was playing wild strains of welcome
as we approached. Come and sail with us, it said&mdash;it
is summer, and the days are long. Care is of the land&mdash;here
the waves flow, and the winds blow, and captain
smiles, and stewardess beguiles, and all is music, music,
music. How the wild, exultant strains rose and fell&mdash;but
everything rose and fell on that boat, as we found out afterward.
Just here a spirit of justice falls on me, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg&nbsp;145]</a></span>
gentle dew from heaven, and forces me to admit that it
rained like a young deluge; that it had been raining for
two days, and the bosom of the deep was heaving with
responsive sympathy; as what bosom would not on which
so many tears had been shed? Perhaps responsive sympathy
was the secret of the Jane Moseley's behavior; but I
would her heart had been less tender. Then, too, the passengers
were few; and of course as we had to divide the
roll and tumble between us, there was a great deal for each
one.</p>

<p>There was a Pretty Girl, and she had a sister who was
not pretty. It seemed to me that even the sad sea waves
were kinder to the Pretty Girl, such is the influence of
youth and beauty. There were various men&mdash;heavy swells
I should call some of them, only that that would be slang;
but heavy swells were the order of the day. Then there
was a benevolent old lady who believed in everything&mdash;in
the music, and the Jane Moseley, and the long days, and
the summer. There was another old lady of restless mind,
who evidently believed in nothing, hoped for nothing, expected
nothing. She tried all the lounges and all the corners,
and found each one a separate disappointment. There
was a fat, fair one, of friendly face, and beside her her grim
guardian, a man so thin that you at once cast him for the
part of Starveling in this Midsummer Day's Dream of Delusion.</p>

<p>We put out from shore&mdash;quite out of sight of shore, in
short&mdash;and then the perfidious music ceased. To the people
on land it had sung, "Come and make merry with us,"
but from us, trying in vain to make merry, it withheld its
deceitful inspiration. For the exceeding weight of sorrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg&nbsp;146]</a></span>
that presently settled down upon us it had no balm. When
you are on a pleasure trip it is unpleasant to be miserable;
so I tried hard to shake off the mild melancholy that began
to steal over me. I said to myself, I will not affront the
great deep with my personal woes. I am but a woman, yet
perhaps on this so great occasion magnanimity of soul will
be possible even to me. I will consider my neighbors and
be wise. At one end of the long saloon a banquet-board
was spread. Its hospitality was, like the other attractions
of the Jane Moseley, a perfidious pageant. Nobody sought
its soup or claimed its clams. One or two sad-eyed young
men made their way in that direction from time to time&mdash;after
their sea-legs, perhaps. From their gait when they
came back I inferred they did not find them. The human
nature in the saloon became a weariness to me. Even the
gentle gambols of the dog Thaddeus, a sportive and spotted
pointer in whom I had been interested, failed to soothe my
perturbed spirits. De Quincey speaks somewhere of "the
awful solitariness of every human soul." No wonder, then,
that I should be solitary among the festive few on board the
Jane Moseley&mdash;no wonder I felt myself darkly, deeply, desperately
blue. I thought I would go on deck. I clung to
my companion with an ardor which would have been flattering
had it been voluntary. My faltering steps were
guided to a seat just within the guards. I sat there thinking
that I had never nursed a dear gazelle, so I could not be
quite sure whether it would have died or not, but I thought
it would. I mused on the changing fortunes of this unsteady
world, and the ingratitude of man. I thought it
would be easier going to the Promised Land if Jordan did
not roll between. Rolling had long ceased to be a pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg&nbsp;147]</a></span>
figure of speech with me. How frail are all things here
below, how false, and yet how fair! My mind is naturally
picturesque. In the midst of my sadness the force of nature
compelled me to grope after an illustration. I could
only think that my own foothold was frail, that the Jane
Moseley was false, that the Pretty Girl was fair. A dizziness
of brain resulted from this rhetorical effort. I silently
confided my sorrows to the sympathizing bosom of the sea.
I was soothed by the kindred melancholy of the sad sea
waves. If the size of the waves were remarkable, other
sighs abounded also, and other things waved&mdash;many of them.</p>

<p>True to my purpose of studying my fellow-beings, and
learning wisdom by observation, I surveyed the Pretty Girl
and her sister, who had by that time come on deck. They
were surrounded by a group of audacious male creatures,
who surrounded most on the side where the Pretty Girl sat.
She did not look feeble. She was like the red, red rose.
It was a conundrum to me why so much greater anxiety
should be bestowed upon her health than upon her sister's.
It needed some moral reflection to make it out; but I concluded
that pretty girls were, by some law of nature, more
subject to sea-sickness than plain ones; therefore, all these
careful cares were quite in order. I saw the two old ladies&mdash;the
benevolent one who had believed so implicitly in all
things, but over whose benign visage doubt had now begun
to settle like a cloud; and the other, who had hoped nothing
from the first, and therefore over whom no disappointment
could prevail&mdash;and, seeing, I mildly wondered
whether, indeed, 'twere better to have loved and lost, or
never to have loved at all.</p>

<p>My thoughts grew solemn. The green shores beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg&nbsp;148]</a></span>
swelling flood seemed farther off than ever. The Jane
Moseley had promised to land us at Newport pier at seven
o'clock. It was already half-past seven; oh, perfidious
Jane! Darkness had settled upon the face of the deep.
We went inside. The sad-eyed young men had evidently
been hunting for their sea-legs again, in the neighborhood
of the banqueting-table, where nobody banqueted. Failing
to find the secret of correct locomotion, they had laid themselves
down to sleep, but in that sleep at sea what dreams
did come, and how noisy they were! The dog Thaddeus
walked by dejectedly, sniffing at the ghost of some half-forgotten
joy. At last there rose a cry&mdash;Newport! The
sleepers started to their feet. I started to mine, but I discreetly
and quietly sat down again. Was it Newport, at
last? Not at all. The harbor lights were gleaming from
afar; and the cry was of the bandmaster shouting to his
emissaries, arousing fiddle and flute and bassoon to their
deceitful duty. They had played us out of port&mdash;they
would play us in again. They had promised us that all
should go merry as a marriage-bell, and&mdash;I would not be
understood to complain, but it had been a sad occasion.
Now the deceitful strains rose and fell again upon the salt
sea wind. The many lights glowed and twinkled from the
near shore. We are all at play, come and play with us,
screamed the soft waltz music. It is summer, and the days
are long, and trouble is not, and care is banished. If the
waves sigh, it is with bliss. Our voyage is ended. It is
sad that you did not sail with us, but we will invite you
again to-morrow, and the band shall play, and the crowd be
gay, and airs beguile, and blue skies smile, and all shall be
music, music, music. But I have sailed with you, on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg&nbsp;149]</a></span>
summer day, bland master of a faithless band; and I know
how soon your pipes are dumb&mdash;I know the tricks and manners
of the clouds and the wind, and the swelling sea, and
Jane Moseley, the perfidious.</p>

<p>I must, after all, have strong local attachments, for when
at last the time came to land I left the ship with lingering
reluctance. My feet seemed fastened to the deck where I
had made my brief home on the much rolling deep. I had
grown used to pain and resigned to fate. I walked the
plank unsteadily. I stood on shore amid the rain and the
mist. A hackman preyed upon me. I was put into an
ancient ark and trundled on through the queer, irresolute,
contradictory old streets, beside the lovely bay, all aglow
with the lighted yachts, as a Southern swamp is with fire-flies.
A torchlight procession met and escorted me. To
this hour I am at a loss to know whether this attention was
a delicate tribute on the part of the city of Newport to a
distinguished guest, or a parting attention from the company
who sail the Jane Moseley, and advertise in the <i>Tribune</i>&mdash;a
final subterfuge to persuade a tortured passenger, by
means of this transitory glory, that the sail upon a summer
sea had been a pleasure trip.&mdash;<i>Letter to New York Tribune.</i></p>

<span class="i1">With dancing, and jumping, and leaps by the sea?<br /></span>
<span class="i3">For wintry weather<br /></span>
<span class="i3">They won't hold together,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Seal-skins and bear-skins all dropping round<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Off from our shoulders down to the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The thorns, the tiresome thorns, will prick,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Mrs. Mackerel sat in her little room,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Back of her husband's grocery store,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Trying to see through the evening gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To finish the baby's pinafore.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She stitched away with a steady hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Though her heart was sore, to the very core,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To think of the troublesome little band,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">(There were seven, or more),<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the trousers, frocks, and aprons they wore,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Made and mended by her alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Slave, slave!" she said, in a mournful tone;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"And let us slave, and contrive, and fret,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I don't suppose we shall ever get<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A little home which is all our own,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">With my own front door<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Apart from the store,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the smell of fish and tallow no more."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">These words to herself she sadly spoke,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">"Wife, we're&mdash;we're&mdash;we're, wife, we're&mdash;we're <i>rich</i>!"<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And pearls and diamonds, likely, beside!"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Mrs. Mackerel's spirits rose like yeast&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"How lucky I married you, Mac," she cried.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then the two broke forth into frantic glee.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A customer hearing the strange commotion,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Peeped into the little back-room, and he<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was seized with the very natural notion<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That the Mackerel family had gone insane;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So he ran away with might and main.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Mac shook his partner by both her hands;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They dance, they giggle, they laugh, they stare;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And now on his head the grocer stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dancing a jig with his feet in air&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Remarkable feat for a man of his age,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who never had danced upon any stage<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But the High-Bridge stage, when he set on top,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And whose green-room had been a green-grocer's shop.<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Is not very strange, if the tales they tell<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of her youthful days have any foundation.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But let that pass with her former life&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i1">'Twas enough the soberest fancy to tickle<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To see the two Mackerels in such a pickle!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It was three o'clock when they got to bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Even then through Mrs. Mackerel's head<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Such gorgeous dreams went whirling away,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">It had fretted her long and fretted her sore<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To live in the rear of the grocery-store.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And several times she was heard to say<br /></span>
<span class="i3">She would sell her soul for a year and a day<br /></span>
<span class="i3">To the King of Brimstone, Fire, and Pitch,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">For the power and pleasure of being rich.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Now her ambition had scope to work&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Leaving her husband with nothing in life<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But to smoke, eat, drink, and obey his wife.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She built a house with a double front-door,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A marble house in the modern style,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With silver planks in the entry floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And carpets of extra-magnificent pile.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And in the hall, in the usual manner,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"A statue," she said, "of the chased Diana;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Though who it was chased her, or whether they<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Caught her or not, she could, really, not say."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A carriage with curtains of yellow satin&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Were turned by the vision meeting them there.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The stilts they sparkled and flashed and shone<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like the tremulous lights of the frigid zone,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Crimson and yellow and sapphire and green,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Bright as the rainbows in summer seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">While the lady she strode along between<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With a majesty too supremely serene<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For anything <i>but</i> an American queen.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A lady with jewels superb as those,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And wearing such very expensive clothes,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Might certainly do whatever she chose!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And thus, in despite of the jeering noise,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the frantic delight of the little boys,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The stilts were a very decided success.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The <i>cr&ecirc;me de la cr&ecirc;me</i> paid profoundest attention,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The merchants' clerks bowed in such wild excess,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When she entered their shops, that they strained their spines,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And afterward went into rapid declines.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The papers, next day, gave her flattering mention;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"The wife of our highly-esteemed fellow-citizen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A Mackerel, of Codfish Square, in this city,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Scorning French fashions, herself has hit on one<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So very piquant and stylish and pretty,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We trust our fair friends will consider it treason<br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Not</i> to walk upon stilts, by the close of the season."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Mrs. Mackerel, now, was never seen<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Out of her chamber, day or night,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Unless her stilts were along&mdash;her mien<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was very imposing from such a height,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It imposed upon many a dazzled wight,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who snuffed the perfume floating down<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From the rustling folds of her gorgeous gown,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But never could smell through these bouquets<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The fishy odor of former days.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg&nbsp;166]</a></span>
<span class="i1">She went on her golden stilts to pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which never became her better than then,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When her murmuring lips were heard to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Thank God, I am not as my fellow-men!"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Her pastor loved as a pastor might&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His house that was built on a golden rock;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He pointed it out as a shining light<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the lesser lambs of his fleecy flock.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The stilts were a help to the church, no doubt,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They kindled its self-expiring embers,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So that before the season was out<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It gained a dozen excellent members.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Mrs. Mackerel gave a superb soir&eacute;e,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Standing on stilts to receive her guests;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The gas-lights mimicked the glowing day<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So well, that the birds, in their flowery nests,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Almost burst their beautiful breasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Trilling away their musical stories<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In Mrs. Mackerel's conservatories.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She received on stilts; a distant bow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was all the loftiest could attain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Though some of her friends she did allow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To kiss the hem of her jewelled train.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">One gentleman screamed himself quite hoarse<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Requesting her to dance; which, of course,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Couldn't be done on stilts, as she<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Halloed down to him rather scornfully.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">The fact is, when Mackerel kept a shop,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His wife was very fond of a hop,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And now, as the music swelled and rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She felt a tingling in her toes,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A restless, tickling, funny sensation<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Which didn't agree with her exaltation.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">When the maddened music was at its height,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the waltz was wildest&mdash;behold, a sight!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The stilts began to hop and twirl<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like the saucy feet of a ballet-girl.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg&nbsp;167]</a></span>
<span class="i1">And their haughty owner, through the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Was spin, spin, spinning everywhere.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Everybody got out of the way<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To give the dangerous stilts fair play.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In every corner, at every door,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With faces looking like unfilled blanks,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They watched the stilts at their airy pranks,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Giving them, unrequested, the floor.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They never had glittered so bright before;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The light it flew in flashing splinters<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Away from those burning, revolving centres;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">While the gems on the lady's flying skirts<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Gave out their light in jets and spirts.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Poor Mackerel gazed in mute dismay<br /></span>
<span class="i1">At this unprecedented display.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Oh, stop, love, stop!" he cried at last;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But she only flew more wild and fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">While the flutes and fiddles, bugle and drum,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Followed as if their time had come.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">She went at such a bewildering pace<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nobody saw the lady's face,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But only a ring of emerald light<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From the crown she wore on that fatal night.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whether the stilts were propelling her,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or she the stilts, none could aver.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Around and around the magnificent hall<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Mrs. Mackerel danced at her own grand ball.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i1">Could it be that the soft, alluring waltz<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had carried her back to a former age,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Making her memory play her false,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till she dreamed herself on the gaudy stage?<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"Pride," they say, "must have a fall&mdash;"<br /></span>

<span class="i2">While the music swelled more fast and loud.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">The gazers shuddered with mute affright,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Did out of the lady's garments flow.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And what was that very peculiar smell?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fish, or brimstone? no one could tell.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Stronger and stronger the odor grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the stilts and the lady burned more blue;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">'Round and around the long saloon,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">While Mackerel gazed in a partial swoon,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She approached the throng, or circled from it,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With a flaming train like the last great comet;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Till at length the crowd<br /></span>
<span class="i3">All groaned aloud.<br /></span>

<span class="i1">On a flying fish with a lambent tail;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And some are sure she went out of the room<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Riding her stilts like a witch a broom,<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It's easy to talk of the patience of Job. Humph! Job had nothin' to try him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ef he'd been married to 'Bijah Brown, folks wouldn't have dared come nigh him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trials, indeed! Now I'll tell you what&mdash;ef you want to be sick of your life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jest come and change places with me a spell, for I'm an inventor's wife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sech inventions! I'm never sure when I take up my coffee-pot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That 'Bijah hain't been "improvin'" it, and it mayn't go off like a shot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, didn't he make me a cradle once that would keep itself a-rockin',<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And didn't it pitch the baby out, and wasn't his head bruised shockin'?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there was his "patent peeler," too, a wonderful thing I'll say;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it hed one fault&mdash;it never stopped till the apple was peeled away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As for locks and clocks, and mowin' machines, and reapers, and all such trash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, 'Bijah's invented heaps of them, but they don't bring in no cash!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Law! that don't worry him&mdash;not at all; he's the aggravatinest man&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'll set in his little workshop there, and whistle and think and plan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inventin' a Jews harp to go by steam, or a new-fangled powder-horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the children's goin' barefoot to school, and the weeds is chokin' our corn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When 'Bijah and me kep' company, he wasn't like this, you know;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our folks all thought he was dreadful smart&mdash;but that was years ago.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was handsome as any pictur' then, and he had such a glib, bright way&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never thought that a time would come when I'd rue my weddin'-day;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg&nbsp;171]</a></span><span class="i0">But when I've been forced to chop the wood, and tend to the farm beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And look at 'Bijah a-settin' there, I've jest dropped down and cried.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We lost the hull of our turnip crop while he was inventin' a gun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I counted it one of my marcies when it bust before 'twas done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he turned it into a "burglar alarm." It ought to give thieves a fright&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twould scare an honest man out of his wits, ef he sot it off at night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes I wonder ef 'Bijah's crazy, he does such curious things.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have I told you about his bedstead yit? 'Twas full of wheels and springs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It hed a key to wind it up, and a clock-face at the head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All you did was to turn them hands, and at any hour you said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bed got up and shook itself, and bounced you on the floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then shet up, jest like a box, so you couldn't sleep any more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wa'al, 'Bijah he fixed it all complete, and he sot it at half-past five,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he hadn't more 'n got into it, when&mdash;dear me! sakes alive!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Them wheels began to whizz and whirr! I heard a fearful snap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there was that bedstead with 'Bijah inside shet up jest like a trap!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I screamed, of course, but 'twant no use. Then I worked that hull long night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-tryin' to open the pesky thing. At last I got in a fright:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I couldn't hear his voice inside, and I thought he might be dyin',<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I took a crowbar and smashed it in. There was 'Bijah peacefully lyin',<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inventin' a way to git out agin. That was all very well to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I don't believe he'd have found it out if I'd left him in all day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, since I've told you my story, do you wonder I'm tired of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or think it strange I often wish I warn't an inventor's wife?<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I dreamed a dream in the midst of my slumbers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as fast as I dreamed it, it came into numbers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My thoughts ran along in such beautiful meter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm sure I ne'er saw any poetry sweeter:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seemed that a law had been recently made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That a tax on old bachelors' pates should be laid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in order to make them all willing to marry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tax was as large as a man could well carry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bachelors grumbled and said 'twas no use&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas horrid injustice and horrid abuse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And declared that to save their own hearts' blood from spilling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of such a vile tax they would not pay a shilling.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the rulers determined them still to pursue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So they set all the old bachelors up at vendue:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A crier was sent through the town to and fro,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rattle his bell and a trumpet to blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to call out to all he might meet in his way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ho! forty old bachelors sold here to-day!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And presently all the old maids in the town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each in her very best bonnet and gown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From thirty to sixty, fair, plain, red and pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of every description, all flocked to the sale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The auctioneer then in his labor began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And called out aloud, as he held up a man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"How much for a bachelor? Who wants to buy?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a twink, every maiden responsed, "I&mdash;I!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In short, at a highly extravagant price,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bachelors all were sold off in a trice:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forty old maidens, some younger, some older,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each lugged an old bachelor home on her shoulder.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">'Twas the height of the gay season, and I cannot tell the reason,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But at a dinner party given by Mrs. Major Thwing<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It became my pleasant duty to take out a famous beauty&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The prettiest woman present. I was happy as a king.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Her dress beyond a question was an artist's best creation;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A miracle of loveliness was she from crown to toe.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Her smile was sweet as could be, her voice just as it should be&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Not high, and sharp, and wiry, but musical and low.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Her hair was soft and flossy, golden, plentiful and glossy;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her eyes, so blue and sunny, shone with every inward grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I could see that every fellow in the room was really yellow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With jealousy, and wished himself that moment in my place.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">As the turtle soup we tasted, like a gallant man I hasted<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To pay some pretty tribute to this muslin, silk, and gauze;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But she turned and softly asked me&mdash;and I own the question tasked me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What were my fixed opinions on the present Suffrage laws.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg&nbsp;180]</a></span></div>

<span class="i2">The remark I thought a safe one&mdash;I could hardly made a worse;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With a smile like any Venus, she gave me its name and genus,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And opened very calmly a botanical discourse.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">But I speedily recovered. As her taper fingers hovered,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like a tender benediction, in a little bit of fish,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Further to impair digestion, she brought up the Eastern Question.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By that time I fully echoed that other fellow's wish.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">And, as sure as I'm a sinner, right on through that endless dinner<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Did she talk of moral science, of politics and law,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of natural selection, of Free Trade and Protection,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till I came to look upon her with a sort of solemn awe.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Just to hear the lovely woman, looking more divine than human,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Talk with such discrimination of Ingersoll and Cook,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With such a childish, sweet smile, quoting Huxley, Mill, and Carlyle&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It was quite a revelation&mdash;it was better than a book.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Chemistry and mathematics, agriculture and chromatics,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Music, painting, sculpture&mdash;she knew all the tricks of speech;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Bas-relief and chiaroscuro, and at last the Indian Bureau&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She discussed it quite serenely, as she trifled with a peach.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">I have seen some dreadful creatures, with vinegary features,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With their fearful store of learning set me sadly in eclipse;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Or the Eastern Question settled by such a pair of lips.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Never saw I a dainty maiden so remarkably o'erladen<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From lip to tip of finger with the love of books and men;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Quite in confidence I say it, and I trust you'll not betray it,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Though I met her in the summer, when one's heart lies 'round at ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it were in tennis costume, and a man's not hard to please;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I think at any season to have met her was to love,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When she said that she should study elocution in the fall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I admit her earliest efforts were not in the Ercles vein:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She began with "Lit-tle Maaybel, with her faayce against the paayne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the beacon-light a-trrremble&mdash;" which, although it made me wince,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is a thing of cheerful nature to the things she's rendered since.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Having learned the Soulful Quiver, she acquired the Melting Mo-o-an,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the way she gave "Young Grayhead" would have liquefied a stone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the Sanguinary Tragic did her energies employ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she tore my taste to tatters when she slew "The Polish Boy."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It's not pleasant for a fellow when the jewel of his soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wades through slaughter on the carpet, while her orbs in frenzy roll:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What was I that I should murmur? Yet it gave me grievous pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When she rose in social gatherings and searched among the slain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I was forced to look upon her, in my desperation dumb&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knowing well that when her awful opportunity was come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She would give us battle, murder, sudden death at very least&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a skeleton of warning, and a blight upon the feast.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Once, ah! once I fell a-dreaming; some one played a polonaise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I associated strongly with those happier August days;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I mused, "I'll speak this evening," recent pangs forgotten quite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sudden shrilled a scream of anguish: "Curfew <span class="smcap">SHALL</span> not ring to-night!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, that sound was as a curfew, quenching rosy warm romance!<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Bless my heart! You've come at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Awful glad to see you, dear!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thought you'd died or something, Belle&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Such</i> an age since you've been here!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My engagement? Gracious! Yes.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rumor's hit the mark this time.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the victim? Charley Gray.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Know him, don't you? Well, he's <i>prime</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Such mustachios! splendid style!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then he's not so horrid fast&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Waltzes like a seraph, too;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Has some fortune&mdash;best and last.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Love him? Nonsense. Don't be "soft;"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pretty much as love now goes;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He's devoted, and in time<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I'll get used to him, I 'spose.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">First love? Humbug. Don't talk stuff!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bella Brown, don't be a fool!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Next you'd rave of flames and darts,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like a chit at boarding-school;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Don't be "miffed." I talked just so<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some two years back. Fact, my dear!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But two seasons kill romance,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Leave one's views of life quite clear.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Why, if Will Latrobe had asked<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg&nbsp;184]</a></span>
<span class="i1">I'd have thrown up all and gone<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Out to Kansas, do you know?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fancy me a settler's wife!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Blest escape, dear, was it not?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Yes; it's hardly in my line<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To enact "Love in a Cot."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Well, you see, I'd had my swing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Been engaged to eight or ten,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Got to stop some time, of course,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So it don't much matter when.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Auntie hates old maids, and thinks<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Every girl should marry young&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On that theme my whole life long<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I have heard the changes sung.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So, <i>ma belle</i>, what could I do?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Charley wants a stylish wife.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We'll suit well enough, no fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When we settle down for life.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But for love-stuff! See my ring!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lovely, isn't it? Solitaire.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nearly made Maud Hinton turn<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Green with envy and despair.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Her's ain't half so nice, you see.<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Did</i> I write you, Belle, about<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How she tried for Charley, till<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I sailed in and cut her out?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Now, she's taken Jack McBride,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I believe it's all from pique&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Threw him over once, you know&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hates me so she'll scarcely speak.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Oh, yes! Grace Church, Brown, and that&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pa won't mind expense at last<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I'll be off his hands for good;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cost a fortune two years past.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My trousseau shall outdo Maud's,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I've <i>carte blanche</i> from Pa, you know&mdash;<br /></span>

<p>Women are often extremely humorous in their newspaper
letters, excelling in that department. As critics they incline
to satire. No one who read them at the time will
ever forget Mrs. Runkle's review of "St. Elmo," or Gail
Hamilton's criticism of "The Story of Avis," while Mrs.
Rollins, in the <i>Critic</i>, often uses a scimitar instead of a
quill, though a smile always tempers the severity. She
thus beheads a poetaster who tells the public that his "solemn
song" is</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Attempt ambitious, with a ray of hope<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To pierce the dark abysms of thought, to guide<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Its dim ghosts o'er the towering crags of Doubt<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Unto the land where Peace and Love abide,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of flowers and streams, and sun and stars."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"His 'solemn song' is certainly very solemn for a song
with so cheerful a purpose. We have rarely read, indeed,
a book with so large a proportion of unhappy words in it.
Frozen shrouds, souls a-chill with agony, things wan and
gray, icy demons, scourging willow-branches, snow-heaped
mounds, black and freezing nights, cups of sorrow drained
to the lees, etc., are presented in such profusion that to
struggle through the 'dark abyss' in search of the 'ray
of hope' is much like taking a cup of poison to learn the
sweetness of its antidote. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; in one of his stanzas
invites his soul to 'come and walk abroad' with him. If
he ever found it possible to walk abroad without his soul,
the fact would have been worth chronicling; but if it is
true that he only desires to have his soul with him occasionally,
we should advise him to walk abroad alone, and invite
his soul to sit beside him in the hours he devotes to composition."</p>

<p>Then humor is displayed in the excellent parodies by
women&mdash;as Grace Greenwood's imitations of various authors,
written in her young days, but quite equal to the
"Echo Club" of Bayard Taylor. How perfect her mimicry
of Mrs. Sigourney!</p>

<span class="i1">She sunk at last, just at the "finis" sunk!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And closed her eyes forever! The soul-gem<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Had fretted through its casket!<br /></span>
<span class="i11">As I stood<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Beside her tomb, I made a solemn vow<br /></span>

<span class="i4">My publisher I sought,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A learned man and good. He took the work,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Read here and there a line, then laid it down,<br /></span>

<p>Ph&oelig;be Cary's parody on "Maud Muller" I never fancied;
it seems almost wicked to burlesque anything so perfect.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="blockintro">PARODIES&mdash;REVIEWS&mdash;CHILDREN'S POEMS&mdash;COMEDIES BY WOMEN&mdash;A
DRAMATIC TRIFLE&mdash;A STRING OF FIRECRACKERS.</p>

<p>It is surprising that we have so few comedies from
women. Dr. Doran mentions five Englishwomen who
wrote successful comedies. Of these, three are now forgotten;
one, Aphra Behn, is remembered only to be despised
for her vulgarity. She was an undoubted wit, and
was never dull, but so wicked and coarse that she forfeited
all right to fame.</p>

<p>Susanna Centlivre left nineteen plays full of vivacity and
fun and lively incident. The <i>Bold Stroke for a Wife</i> is
now considered her best. The <i>Basset Table</i> is also a
superior comedy, especially interesting because it anticipates
the modern blue-stocking in Valeria, a philosophical girl
who supports vivisection, and has also a prophecy of exclusive
colleges for women.</p>

<p>There is nothing worthy of quotation in any of these
comedies. Some sentences from Mrs. Centlivre's plays are
given in magazine articles to prove her wit, but we say so
much brighter things in these days that they must be considered
stale platitudes, as:</p>

<p>"You may cheat widows, orphans, and tradesmen without
a blush, but a debt of honor, sir, must be paid."</p>

<p>"Quarrels, like mushrooms, spring up in a moment."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg&nbsp;196]</a></span></p>
<p>"Woman is the greatest sovereign power in the world."</p>

<p>Hans Andersen in his Autobiography mentions a Madame
von Weissenthurn, who was a successful actress and dramatist.
Her comedies are published in fourteen volumes. In our
country several comedies written by women, but published
anonymously, have been decided hits. Mrs. Verplanck's
<i>Sealed Instructions</i> was a marked success, and years ago
<i>Fashion</i>, by Anna Cora Mowatt, had a remarkable run.
By the way, those roaring farces, <i>Belles of the Kitchen</i> and
<i>Fun in a Fog</i>, were written for the Vokes family by an
aunt of theirs. And I must not forget to state that Gilbert's
<i>Palace of Truth</i> was cribbed almost bodily from
Madame de Genlis's "Tales of an Old Castle." Mrs. Julia
Schayer, of Washington, has given us a domestic drama in
one act, entitled <i>Struggling Genius</i>.</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>I have reserved for the close numerous instances of
woman's facility at badinage and repartee. It is there,
after all, that she shines perennial and pre-eminent. You
will excuse me if I give them to you one after another
without comment, like a closing display of fireworks.</p>

<p>And first let me quote from Mrs. Rollins, as an instance
of the way in which women often react upon each other in
repartee, a little conversation which it was once her privilege
to overhear:</p>

<p>"<i>Margaret.</i> I wonder you never have been married,
Kate. Of course you've had lots of chances. Won't you
tell us how many?</p>

<p>"<i>Kate.</i> No, indeed! I could not so cruelly betray my
rejected lovers.</p>

<p>"<i>Helen.</i> Of course you wouldn't tell us <i>exactly</i>; but
would you mind giving it to us in round numbers?</p>

<p>"<i>Kate.</i> Certainly not; the roundest number of all exactly
expresses the chances I have had.</p>

<p>"<i>Charlotte</i> (<i>with a sigh</i>). Now I know what people mean
by Kate's <i>circle of admirers</i>!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg&nbsp;203]</a></span></p>
<hr class="hr25" />

<p>A lady was discussing the relative merits and demerits of
the two sexes with a gentleman of her acquaintance. After
much badinage on one side and the other, he said: "Well,
you never yet heard of casting seven devils out of a man."
"No," was the quick retort, "<i>they've got 'em yet</i>!"</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>"What would you do in time of war if you had the
suffrage?" said Horace Greeley to Mrs. Stanton.</p>

<p>"Just what you have done, Mr. Greeley," replied the
ready lady; "stay at home and urge others to go and
fight!"</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>It was Margaret Fuller who worsted Mrs. Greeley in a
verbal encounter. The latter had a decided aversion to kid
gloves, and on meeting Margaret shrank from her extended
hand with a shudder, saying: "Ugh! Skin of a beast!
skin of a beast!"</p>

<p>"Why," said Miss Fuller, in surprise, "what do you
wear?"</p>

<p>"<i>Silk</i>," said Mrs. Greeley, stretching out her palm with
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Miss Fuller just touched it, saying, with a disgusted expression,
"Ugh! entrails of a worm! entrails of a worm!"</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>Mademoiselle de Mars, the former favorite of the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre
de Fran&ccedil;ais, had in some way offended the Gardes du
Corps. So one night they came in full force to the theatre
and tried to hiss her down.</p>

<p>The actress, unabashed, came to the front of the stage,
and alluding to the fact that the Gardes du Corps never
went to war, said: "What has Mars to do with the Gardes
du Corps?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg&nbsp;204]</a></span></p>
<hr class="hr25" />

<p>Madame Louis de S&eacute;gur is daughter of the late Casimir
P&eacute;rier, who was Minister of the Interior during Thiers's
administration. When once out of office, but still an influential
member of the House, he once tried to form a new
Moderate Republican party, meeting with but little success.</p>

<p>Once his daughter, who was sitting in the gallery, saw
him entering the House <i>all alone</i>.</p>

<p>"Here comes my father with his party," she said.</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>I was greatly amused at the quiet reprimand given by a
literary lady of New York to a stranger at her receptions,
who, with hands crossed complacently under his coat-tails,
was critically examining the various treasures in her room,
humming obtrusively as he passed along.</p>

<p>The hostess paused near him, surveyed him critically, and
then inquired, in a gentle tone: "Do you play also?"</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>A young girl being asked why she had not been more
frequently to Lenten services, excused herself in this fashion,
severe, but truthful: "Oh, Dr. &mdash;&mdash; is on such intimate
terms with the Almighty that I felt <i>de trop</i>."</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>At a reception in Washington this spring an admirable
answer was given by a level-headed woman&mdash;we are all
proud of Miss Cleveland&mdash;to a fine-looking army officer,
who has been doing guard duty in that magnificent city for
the past seventeen years. "Pray," said he, "what do
ladies find to think about besides dress and parties?"</p>

<p>"They can think of the heroic deeds of our modern army
officers," was her smiling reply.</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>Do you remember Lydia Maria Child's reply to her
husband when he wished he was as rich as Cr&oelig;sus: "At
any rate, you are King of Lydia;" and Lucretia Mott's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg&nbsp;205]</a></span>humorous comment when she entered a room where her
husband and his brother Richard were sitting, both of them
remarkable for their taciturnity and reticence: "I thought
you must both be here&mdash;it was so still!"</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>In my own home I recall a sensible old maid of Scotch
descent with her cosey cottage and the dear old-fashioned
garden where she loved to work. Our physician, a man of
infinite humor, who honestly admired her sterling worth,
and was attracted by her individuality, leaned over her
fence one bright spring morning, with the direct question:
"Miss Sharp, why did you never get married?"</p>

<p>She looked up from her weeding, rested on her hoe-handle,
and looking steadily at his hair, which was of a
sandy hue, answered: "I'll tell you all about it, Doctor.
I made up my mind, when I was a girl, that, come what
would, I would never marry a red-headed man, and none
but men with red hair have ever offered themselves."</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>We all know women whose capacity for monologue exhausts
all around them. So that the remark will be appreciated
of a lady to whom I said, alluding to such a talker:
"Have you seen Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; lately?"</p>

<p>"No, I really had to give up her acquaintance in despair,
for I had been trying two years to tell her something in
particular."</p>

<p>A lady once told me she could always know when she had
taken too much wine at dinner&mdash;her husband's jokes began
to seem funny!</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>Lastly and&mdash;<i>finally</i>, there is a reason for our apparent
lack of humor, which it may seem ungracious to mention.
Women do not find it politic to cultivate or express their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg&nbsp;206]</a></span>wit. No man likes to have his story capped by a better and
fresher from a lady's lips. What woman does not risk
being called sarcastic and hateful if she throws back the
merry dart, or indulges in a little sharp-shooting? No, no,
it's dangerous&mdash;if not fatal.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Though you're bright, and though you're pretty,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They'll not love you if you're witty."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Madame de Sta&euml;l and Madame R&eacute;camier are good illustrations
of this point. The former, by her fearless expressions
of wit, exposed herself to the detestation of the majority
of mankind. "She has shafts," said Napoleon, "which
would hit a man if he were seated on a rainbow."</p>

<p>But the sweetly fawning, almost servile adulation of the
<i>listening</i> beauty brought her a corresponding throng of
admirers. It sometimes seems that what is pronounced wit,
if uttered by a distinguished man, would be considered
commonplace if expressed by a woman.</p>

<p>Parker's illustration of Choate's <i>rare humor</i> never struck
me as felicitous. "Thus, a friend meeting him one ten-degrees-below-zero
morning in the winter, said: 'How cold
it is, Mr. Choate.' 'Well, it is not absolutely tropical,' he
replied, with a most mirthful emphasis."</p>

<p>And do you recollect the only time that Wordsworth was
<i>really</i> witty? He told the story himself at a dinner.
"Gentlemen, I never was really witty but once in my life."
Of course there was a general call for the bright but solitary
instance. And the contemplative bard continued: "Well,
gentlemen, I was standing at the door of my cottage on
Rydal Mount, one fine summer morning, and a laborer said
to me: 'Sir, have you seen my wife go by this way?'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg&nbsp;207]</a></span>And I replied:
'My good man, I did not know until this
moment that you <i>had</i> a wife!'"</p>

<p>He paused; the company waited for the promised witticism,
but discovering that he had finished, burst into a
long and hearty roar, which the old gentleman accepted complacently
as a tribute to his brilliancy.</p>

<p>The wit of women is like the airy froth of champagne,
or the witching iridescence of the soap-bubble, blown for a
moment's sport. The sparkle, the life, the fascinating
foam, the gay tints vanish with the occasion, because there
is no listening Boswell with unfailing memory and capacious
note-book to preserve them.</p>

<p>Then, unlike men, women do not write out their impromptus
beforehand and carefully hoard them for the
publisher&mdash;and posterity!</p>

<hr class="hr25" />

<p>And now, dear friends, a cordial <i>au revoir</i>.</p>

<p>My heartiest thanks to the women who have so generously
allowed me to ransack their treasuries, filching here and
there as I chose, always modestly declaiming against the
existence of wit in what they had written.</p>

<p>To various publishers in New York and Boston, who
have been most courteous and liberal, credit is given elsewhere.</p>

<p>Touched by the occasion, I "drop into" doggerel:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i31">If you pronounce this book not funny,<br /></span>
<span class="i31">And wish you hadn't spent your money,<br /></span>
<span class="i31">There soon will be a general rumor<br /></span>
<span class="i31">That you're no judge of Wit or Humor.<br /></span>
